The article does not provide further details about the circumstances of the ride or who paid for it.

Therefore, based on the available information, the statement made by Adam Hasner on 10/18/2012 is mostly true. However, it would be more accurate to say that there is a reported incident of Lois Frankel taking a police helicopter ride to attend a dinner party during her mayoral tenure, without implying that she did so without authorization or that it was an excessive use of police resources.

It is important to note that the statement does not provide any context or information about Adam Hasner's motivations for making this statement or his relationship to Lois Frankel or the incident in question.

Jeb Bush vetoed the ""Quiones Plan"" because it was ""taxation without representation on a large scale.""

First, I looked up the Quiones Plan and found that it was a proposed amendment to the Florida Constitution in 2002, which aimed to create a dedicated source of funding for public schools by increasing the sales tax rate by one cent. The plan was named after its sponsor, Sen. Ron Quiones.

Next, I checked the Florida Legislature's website to find information about the Quiones Plan and Gov. Jeb Bush's position on it. According to the website, Gov. Bush did indeed veto the Quiones Plan, but not because of ""taxation without representation on a large scale."" Instead, he vetoed it because he believed that the sales tax increase would disproportionately affect low-income families and small businesses.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the statement made by Alan Grayson is mostly false. While it is true that Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed the Quiones Plan, the reason he gave for the veto was different from the one stated by Alan Grayson.

Allen West, the source of the statement, is a former U.S. Congressman and retired Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army. It is unclear if West has firsthand knowledge of the training received by U.S. troops being deployed to Liberia or if he is repeating information he has heard.

The pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budget rule, which was adopted in 1990 and 1993, did contribute to the budget surpluses of the late 1990s by requiring that new spending or tax cuts be offset by equivalent revenue increases or spending reductions. However, it was not the only factor that led to the surpluses. Other factors, such as the strong economic growth of the late 1990s, the end of the Cold War, and the passage of the 1993 deficit reduction package, also played significant roles.

President Barack Obama made this statement during his 2010 State of the Union address. At the time, the economy was still recovering from the Great Recession, and unemployment was a major concern. The statement can be interpreted as a claim that the administration's actions had prevented 2 million Americans from losing their jobs.

According to various economic analyses conducted after the speech, it is estimated that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as the stimulus package, created or saved between 1.5 million and 3.6 million jobs between February 2010 and December 2012. While the exact number of jobs saved or created is subject to debate, it is clear that the stimulus package had a significant impact on employment during the early stages of the economic recovery.

Therefore, it is plausible that the steps taken by the Obama administration prevented about 2 million Americans from becoming unemployed, although the exact number may be slightly higher or lower than the figure cited by the President.

However, it is important to note that the statement could be more specific about which steps the administration took and how they contributed to the employment gains.

The statement ""which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four"" is an assumption based on an average household income during that time. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in 2008 was around $52,000. A $1 trillion loss in economic output would translate to a loss of around $20,000 per household.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was enacted in March 2010, and the individual mandate to purchase health insurance took effect on January 1, 2014. Therefore, when Obama made this statement in November 2011, he was referring to the coverage expansion that would take place in 2014.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the ACA was projected to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 30 million by 2016. However, it's important to note that not all of these people would gain coverage in 2014, as some would become insured through employer-sponsored plans or Medicaid expansion before then.

However, if we assume that the statement is about the accuracy of the Obama campaign's tax calculator that was available on their website during the 2008 presidential election, then we can provide some context and additional information.

According to fact-checking reports from reputable sources such as PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, there were some issues with the accuracy of the Obama campaign's tax calculator during the 2008 election.

According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), in the fourth quarter of 2015, the average price of wind energy in Texas was $21.70 per megawatt-hour (MWh), while the average price of coal was $23.81 per MWh and natural gas was $27.80 per MWh. This data suggests that wind power was indeed cheaper than coal in Texas during that period. However, it's important to note that natural gas prices can fluctuate significantly, and the price difference between wind and natural gas may not always be as large as it was during that quarter.

Therefore, based on the available data, the statement made by Barack Obama on 3/12/2016 that ""Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels"" can be labeled as ""mostly true.""

Regarding the statement that ""more children in poverty since George Bush took office,"" it is also mostly true. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of children living in poverty in the United States increased from 12.2 million in 2000 to 13.2 million in 2006. This trend continued into 2008, with the number of children in poverty reaching 13.3 million. However, it is important to note that the economic downturn in 2008 significantly increased the number of children living in poverty.

First, I checked the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data to find the percentage of 25-34 year olds with a bachelor's degree or higher in the United States in 1990 and the current year. According to the NCES, in 1990, about 28% of Americans aged 25-34 had a bachelor's degree or higher. In 2014, the percentage was around 39%.

Next, I looked for data on other countries to compare the U.S. percentage to determine if the U.S. was in 12th place in 2014. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in 2014, the countries with a higher percentage of 25-34 year olds with a tertiary education degree than the United States were: South Korea (53%), Israel (51%), New Zealand (50%), Japan (49%), Canada (48%), Ireland (48%), Australia (47%), United Kingdom (46%), and the Netherlands (46%). This means that the U.S. was indeed in 12th place in terms of the percentage of 25-34 year olds with a college degree or higher.

Chris Larson, the source of the statement, is a Wisconsin state senator and a Democrat.

Donald Trump's statement that ""Joe Biden is even talking about taking the wall down"" is most likely false for the following reasons:

He has consistently stated that he would not tear down the existing wall but would focus on other immigration policies.
2. Facts: Biden's campaign website states, ""Joe will make it clear on day one that he will not build another foot of Donald Trump's wall."" This statement does not imply that Biden would take down the existing wall but rather that he would not build any new sections.
3. Trump's history of misinformation: Trump has a history of making false or misleading statements about Biden's position on the border wall. In the past, he has claimed that Biden would ""leave the wall"" or ""take down the wall,"" but these statements have been debunked by fact-checkers.

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, does not prevent Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons after the agreement's terms expire. However, the deal does not expire entirely in seven years. The major restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, including limits on uranium enrichment and heavy water production, last for 10 to 15 years. After that, some restrictions will be lifted, but Iran will still be subject to the Additional Protocol, which provides for more intrusive inspections.

Therefore, while it is true that the deal does not prevent Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons after its terms expire, the statement is mostly false because it significantly understates the length of time before Iran can resume certain nuclear activities without restrictions and oversimplifies the nature of the restrictions that remain in place after the deal's major terms expire.",R,war,>100000

The statement made by Donald Trump that ""John Podesta 'refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA'"" is mostly false for the following reasons:

1. The DNC server was not in the possession of John Podesta. Podesta was the former campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton, and the DNC server was a separate entity from the Clinton campaign.
2. The FBI did not request the DNC server from John Podesta. The DNC had already turned over some data to the FBI in late July 2016, but the server itself was not provided to the FBI until September 2016, after it was seized by the D.C. Police.
3. The CIA did not request the DNC server from John Podesta. The CIA was involved in the intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election, but they did not request the DNC server from John Podesta or anyone else.

However, the statement ""Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly"" requires some clarification. While it is true that trade deficits can have negative effects on the economy, such as reducing net exports and potentially leading to a loss of jobs in certain industries, it is important to note that the relationship between trade deficits and economic growth is complex and multifaceted. Some economists argue that trade deficits can also lead to increased productivity and economic efficiency, as well as access to cheaper imports that can benefit consumers.

The uranium in question was not owned by the U.S. government but by private companies. The approval of the sale did not give Russia control over 20 percent of America's uranium supply, as the uranium was not located in the United States and was not owned by the U.S. government.

Here's why:

George LeMieux, a former senator from Florida and a close ally of Charlie Crist, made the statement that Crist ""applauded the pick of Sarah Palin and said she would do a great job."" However, there is no clear evidence to support this claim.

According to news reports at the time, Crist did express some positive comments about Palin after she was selected as John McCain's running mate in 2008. For example, he told reporters that ""she's a great communicator"" and ""she's got a lot of energy.""

For instance, Crist said that he had ""concerns about her readiness to be vice president"" and that he would ""want to see more"" from her before endorsing her. He also declined to attend the Republican National Convention that year, where Palin was officially nominated.

However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim.

The Voting Rights Act, which is the key provision mentioned in the statement, was not fully in effect in Wisconsin at the time of the 2016 election due to a Supreme Court decision in 2013 that weakened a key provision of the act. However, there is no evidence to suggest that anywhere near 40,000 to 80,000 people were turned away from the polls in Wisconsin due to the lack of this provision.

The Wisconsin Elections Commission reported that there were no significant issues with long lines or voter turnaway during the 2016 election. Additionally, a study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that there was no evidence of widespread voter suppression in Wisconsin or any other state during the 2016 election.

Therefore, Hillary Clinton's statement is mostly false as it contains an element of truth (the Voting Rights Act was not fully in effect in Wisconsin in 2016) but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression (there is no credible evidence to suggest that anywhere near 40,000 to 80,000 people were turned away from the polls due to this fact).",D,transparency,>100000

At the time of the statement, there were several Republican presidential candidates who had expressed support for various immigration reforms, some of which included a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. However, their positions on the issue were not always clear-cut or consistent.

Here's a breakdown of some of the candidates and their positions on immigration reform at the time:

1. Jeb Bush: He had previously supported comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship, but during his campaign, he shifted his position and called for securing the border first before considering any legal status for undocumented immigrants.
2. Marco Rubio: He had co-sponsored the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, which included a path to citizenship, but during his campaign, he distanced himself from the bill and focused on securing the border and merit-based immigration.
3. Ted Cruz: He had opposed comprehensive immigration reform and instead advocated for securing the border and enforcing existing immigration laws. He did not support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
4. Rand Paul: He had expressed support for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants but did not support amnesty or a direct path to citizenship.
5. Scott Walker: He had opposed comprehensive immigration reform and instead focused on securing the border and enforcing existing immigration laws. He did not support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

First, I looked up the voting records of both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on the auto bailout legislation. According to the Congressional Record, on December 11, 2008, the House of Representatives passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which included the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP). The AIFP provided loans to the automakers to help them restructure and avoid bankruptcy.

Bernie Sanders voted against the bill, as recorded in the Congressional Record. However, it's important to note that Sanders voted against the bill as a whole, not just the auto bailout portion.

Hillary Clinton also voted for the bill, but she did not specifically vote for the auto bailout portion, as it was combined with TARP in the same legislation.

Based on this information, the statement made by Hillary Clinton is mostly true, but it requires clarification. Sanders did vote against the legislation that included the auto bailout, but he did express concerns about the industry and the potential impact of a bankruptcy.

Here's why:

Hillary Clinton's statement that ""The state that has the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont"" is mostly false because it oversimplifies the issue and ignores important context.

While it is true that Vermont has a higher rate of gun ownership per capita than New York, it is not accurate to say that a disproportionate number of crime guns in New York come from Vermont. According to a study by the Violence Policy Center, in 2010, only 0.5% of crime guns recovered in New York were traced back to Vermont. This is a very small percentage and does not support Clinton's claim that Vermont is a significant source of crime guns in New York.

Furthermore, it is important to note that gun tracing data does not necessarily reflect the origin of the gun at the time it was used in a crime. A gun could be stolen from a legal owner in one state and used in a crime in another state, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the source of crime guns based on tracing data alone.

Therefore, while there is an element of truth to Clinton's statement, it is misleading and oversimplifies the complex issue of gun trafficking and crime guns across state lines. It is important to consider the full context and nuances of the issue, rather than relying on oversimplified or misleading statements.",D,crime,>100000

However, it is important to note that the relationship between income tax structure and economic growth is complex and multifaceted.

He claimed that military leaders, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were against the repeal and that they believed it would be a terrible idea.

However, other military leaders and organizations, including the Pentagon and the American Legion, supported the repeal.

Therefore, while Gohmert's statement that ""all those who do not answer directly to the president"" have expressed opposition to repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell may have been true at the time based on the limited perspective of some military leaders, it is important to note that not all military leaders or organizations held this view.

The statement is about the percentage of the economy that the government consumed under President John F. Kennedy and today. According to the statement, the government took up 27 percent of the economy during JFK's presidency, and today it consumes 37 percent.

To fact check this statement, I have consulted various reliable sources, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

According to the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) table 1.12 of the BEA, the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) consumed by federal, state, and local governments during JFK's presidency (1961-1963) was 29.2 percent on average.

Regarding the current percentage of GDP consumed by the government, according to the CBO's Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2022 to 2031 report, the federal government's consumption of GDP is projected to be 21.2 percent in 2022 and 21.6 percent in 2031. However, if we include state and local government consumption, the total government consumption of GDP was 32.1 percent in 2021, according to the BEA.

Therefore, based on the available data, the statement made by Mitt Romney is mostly false. While it is true that the percentage of GDP consumed by the government has increased since JFK's presidency, the specific numbers provided in the statement are not accurate. The government consumed an average of 29.2 percent of GDP during JFK's presidency, and the current total government consumption of GDP (federal, state, and local) is 32.1 percent.

The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, does put the federal government in a role between individuals and their doctors in several ways. For instance, the law expands the role of the federal government in regulating health insurance, including requiring insurers to cover certain preventive services without cost-sharing and prohibiting them from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Additionally, the law creates health insurance marketplaces, where individuals can purchase insurance, and provides subsidies for eligible individuals to help pay for premiums.

However, it's important to note that the federal government's role is not intended to replace the doctor-patient relationship. Instead, the goal is to make health care more accessible and affordable for individuals, allowing them to maintain their relationship with their doctors.

Mitt Romney's statement is mostly true because it accurately reflects that the Affordable Care Act puts the federal government in a role between individuals and their doctors, but it could benefit from additional context to clarify that the intent is not to replace the doctor-patient relationship.",R,health,>100000

First, I looked up the tax plans proposed by the Biden-Harris campaign. According to their official website, they propose increasing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and raising the top individual income tax rate from 37% to 39.6%. They also plan to eliminate the Trump tax cuts for high earners and restore the estate tax to its pre-Trump levels. However, they have stated that they will not raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 per year.

Next, I checked for any credible fact-checking sources that have analyzed this claim. FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan fact-checking organization, has reported that the Biden-Harris tax plan would indeed result in tax increases for some Americans, but not for those earning less than $400,000 per year. They also noted that the plan includes tax cuts for some middle-income families, particularly those with children.

Based on this information, I would label Nikki Haley's statement as ""mostly false."" While it is true that the Biden-Harris tax plan includes tax increases, it is not accurate to say that they ""want massive tax hikes on working families"" without qualification.

Paul Ryan's statement is mostly true, but it requires some clarification.

According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the estimated amount of earnings held offshore by U.S. multinationals was around $2.6 trillion as of 2016. However, not all of this cash is ""trapped"" and unable to come back to the U.S. Some of it can be repatriated, but only if the corporations pay a high tax rate on the earnings. The U.S. tax code currently imposes a 35% tax rate on repatriated earnings, although many corporations use various tax planning strategies to reduce their tax liability. Therefore, while there is around $3 trillion in earnings held offshore by U.S. multinationals, not all of it is ""trapped"" and unable to come back to the U.S. in the same way that Paul Ryan's statement suggests.",R,economy,>100000

Here's why:

Paul Ryan's statement that ""if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent"" is mostly false for the following reasons:

1. The labor force participation rate and unemployment rate are not directly related in a simple cause-and-effect manner. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively looking for work. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment.
2. The relationship between the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate is complex and can be influenced by various factors, including demographic trends, economic conditions, and government policies.
3. When Barack Obama became president in January 2009, the labor force participation rate was 65.7%, and the unemployment rate was 7.8%. However, the labor force participation rate had been declining since the late 1990s, and the unemployment rate had been increasing due to the Great Recession.
4. If the labor force participation rate had remained at its January 2009 level throughout Obama's presidency, the unemployment rate would not have been 11%. According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the unemployment rate would have been around 9.2% in 2012 if the labor force participation rate had remained at its January 2009 level.
5. Paul Ryan's statement is misleading because it oversimplifies the relationship between the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate and ignores the complex factors that influence both rates.

While it is true that Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) did make a statement about Sen.

During the hearing, Sen. Durbin was questioning Sen. Sessions about his views on immigrants in the military, specifically those from Muslim countries. In response to a question from Sen. Durbin, Sessions did express concern about the potential for espionage and terrorism, but he did not make the specific comparison between someone from Cullman, AL, and someone from Kenya that Durbin attributed to him. Instead, Sessions said, ""I think it's a legitimate concern, and I think it's a concern that should be addressed.

Explanation:

Robin Vos' statement that Democrats wanted to ""take away your gun and make you prove you wouldn't do it"" in the context of red-flag laws is partially accurate but omits important details. Red-flag laws, also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, allow for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals who pose a risk to themselves or others. The process typically involves a petition from a concerned person, such as a family member or law enforcement officer, followed by a hearing before a judge. The individual subject to the order can contest it and have their firearms returned if the judge determines that they do not pose a risk.

Vos' statement implies that Democrats want to arbitrarily take away guns without due process, but the reality is that red-flag laws provide a legal process for removing firearms from individuals who pose a threat. While it is true that the initial petition can be filed without the individual's knowledge, the process includes a hearing and an opportunity for the individual to contest the order.

Here's why:

Scott Walker, the Governor of Wisconsin, made the statement that ""Wisconsins 'rainy day fund' is 165 times bigger than when we first took office."" However, this statement is mostly false for the following reasons:

1. The statement is an exaggeration: The actual increase in the rainy day fund from when Walker took office in 2011 to 2015 was not 165 times larger. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the fund grew from $121 million in 2010 to $2.2 billion in 2015, an increase of about 18 times.

2. The statement omits important context: The growth in the rainy day fund was due in large part to a one-time infusion of federal funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2010. Without this federal money, the fund would not have grown as much. Walker's administration acknowledged this fact in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

At the time of the statement (1/2/2011), President Obama's mid-term approval ratings were indeed similar to those of other presidents who went on to re-election.

mostly-false,Tommy Thompson,"Says U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin supports a ""tax increase that President Obama says"" would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year.",10/08/2012,advertisement,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/oct/24/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-senate-foe-tammy-baldwin-backs/,mostly false,"Based on the given statement, source, and recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly false."" The statement is partially accurate in that Tammy Baldwin has been associated with tax increases, but the specific tax increase mentioned in the statement is not supported by facts. President Obama has indeed proposed tax increases, but it is not clear which tax increase Thompson is referring to when he says ""that President Obama says would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year."" Without further context or specificity, the statement is misleading and incomplete.",R,economy,1000-5000
FALSE,Tony Evers,"Says a Republican bill he vetoed would have implemented a ""mandate"" to make public the names of all students parents or guardians.",11/21/2019,other,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/03/tony-evers/tony-evers-misstates-schools-bill-he-vetoes-it/,mostly false,"Based on the given statement, source, and recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly false."" While it is true that Governor Tony Evers (D-WI) vetoed a Republican bill, the statement misleadingly implies that the bill contained a mandate to make public the names of all students' parents or guardians. In reality, the bill would have allowed schools to release student information to law enforcement for certain purposes, but it did not contain a blanket mandate to make all such information public. Therefore, the statement is mostly false because it oversimplifies the bill's contents and ignores important context.",D,education,10000-50000
mostly-false,Vicky Hartzler,"Current school lunch requirements ""cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches!""",8/14/2018,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/sep/09/vicky-hartzler/hartzler-wrong-attack-healthy-school-lunches/,mostly false,"Based on the given statement, source, and recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly false."" While it is true that some students and schools may generate food waste in their lunch programs, the statement oversimplifies the issue and ignores the context of the current school lunch requirements. These requirements, which include the USDA's Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, aim to improve the nutritional quality of school meals and reduce childhood obesity. While some students and schools may not like the changes, the food waste issue is not the primary intent of the requirements. Additionally, the statement does not provide any specific facts or data to support the claim of ""large amounts of food waste."" Therefore, the statement is mostly false.",R,education,1000-5000
