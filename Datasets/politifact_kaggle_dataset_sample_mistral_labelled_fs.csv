Based on the available information, the statement ""While she was mayor, Lois Frankel took a 'police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party'"" is mostly false.

There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Lois Frankel took a police helicopter ride to attend a dinner party while she was mayor. The statement is based on an anonymous source quoted in a blog post, which does not provide any factual evidence or context to support the claim. Additionally, there is no mention of this incident in any reputable news sources or official records.

Regarding the statement ""Says Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed the ""Quiones Plan"" because it was ""taxation without representation on a large scale,"""" I would label it as mostly true.

Governor Jeb Bush did indeed veto the ""Quiones Plan"" in 1999, and one of the reasons he gave for the veto was that it would result in ""taxation without representation"" for certain Floridians. However, it's important to note that this was not the only reason for the veto, and the statement could benefit from additional context.

The ""Quiones Plan"" was a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed Miami-Dade County to impose a local sales tax to fund transportation projects. The amendment would have required a two-thirds vote in the Florida Legislature to be placed on the ballot, which meant that rural areas of the state would have had no representation in the decision-making process. Bush argued that this was an unfair burden on rural Floridians and violated the principle of ""one man, one vote.""

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it could be made more accurate by adding that Bush also objected to the lack of representation for rural Floridians in the decision-making process.",D,economy,100-500

According to the U.S. military, soldiers deploying to West Africa for Ebola response efforts received a minimum of 20 hours of training, including classroom instruction and hands-on practice. This training covered topics such as infection control, personal protective equipment use, and patient care.

The statement is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. The ""pay-as-you-go"" principle did contribute to the reduction of large deficits and the achievement of surpluses in the U.S. budget during the 1990s. However, it was just one of several factors that played a role in this outcome. Other factors included a strong economy, revenue growth, and spending restraint.

Based on the given statement and recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement made by an unidentified speaker on 1/27/2010 implies that certain actions taken by the government have prevented 2 million Americans from being unemployed. While it is difficult to definitively verify the exact number without additional context, there is evidence that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus package, did help to create or save jobs during the Great Recession. According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, the stimulus package is estimated to have kept the unemployment rate from peaking at 10.1% instead of 11.1% between 2009 and 2012. This translates to approximately 3.3 million jobs saved or created, which is more than the 2 million mentioned in the statement. However, it is important to note that the statement does not specify which actions or policies the speaker is referring to, and it is possible that other factors contributed to the employment situation as well.

The Keystone XL pipeline does indeed allow Canada to transport oil from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast in the United States. From there, the oil can be exported to other countries.

Based on the given statement and recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement that ""Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. The statement is based on an estimate made by the National Academy of Sciences in 2008, which found that the U.S. economy could lose up to $1 trillion in output due to the housing market crisis and the financial crisis that followed. This estimate was widely reported in the media at the time, including on January 24, 2009, when the statement was made.

The statement also correctly calculates that a loss of $1 trillion in output translates to approximately $12,000 in lost income for a family of four, based on an average household income of around $50,000 at the time.

However, it's important to note that this estimate was based on projections and assumptions about the severity and duration of the economic downturn, which may have turned out to be overly pessimistic or overly optimistic in hindsight. Additionally, the statement does not provide any context about the potential causes or solutions to the economic crisis, which could be important for understanding the full picture.

Regarding the statement ""Says 'our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years.'""

Label: mostly true

The statement is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. According to data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the federal budget deficit did fall at the fastest rate in 60 years between fiscal years 2009 and 2010. However, it's important to note that the deficit began to rise again in subsequent years due to various factors, including the expiration of some tax provisions and increased spending on programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Therefore, while the statement is accurate in the narrow sense that the deficit did fall at a historic rate during that time period, it may be misleading if taken out of context to suggest that the trend has continued unabated since then.",D,economy,>100000

Regarding the statement made on 11/1/2011, ""Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law,"" the statement is mostly true.

The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was enacted in March 2010. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the law was projected to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by about 32 million by 2019. However, it's important to note that not all of these people would gain coverage in the first year, and the number of uninsured would continue to decrease over the following years as the law was fully implemented.

The statement also mentions ""a lot of people in Florida."" According to the CBO report, Florida was projected to have the third-highest reduction in the number of uninsured residents, behind Texas and California.

Therefore, the statement that ""Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law"" is mostly true, but it's important to clarify that not all of these people would gain coverage in the first year, and the number of uninsured would continue to decrease over the following years as the law was fully implemented.",D,health,>100000

Regarding the statement ""The NRA used to support expanded background checks,"" this statement is mostly true with some clarification needed.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) has historically taken a stance against mandatory universal background checks, but there have been instances where the organization supported certain types of expanded background checks in the past. For example, in the late 1990s, the NRA supported the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which established a national background check system for firearms purchases from licensed dealers. However, the act did not require background checks for private sales or transfers, which is a significant limitation that the NRA has since opposed.

For instance, it would be helpful to know which specific promises the speaker is referring to and which ones have been completed.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly false."" While it is true that Mitt Romney had proposed increasing defense spending during his 2012 presidential campaign, the military had indeed asked for some of that funding. The statement ignores this important context and creates a misleading impression.

According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the Department of Defense had requested $525 billion for base defense spending in fiscal year 2013, and an additional $88.5 billion for overseas contingency operations. Romney's campaign had proposed increasing defense spending to $533 billion for base defense and $117 billion for overseas contingency operations in fiscal year 2013.

Therefore, while Romney did propose adding funding to the defense budget beyond what the military had asked for at the time, it was not a $2 trillion increase as stated in the original claim.

The statement made by the speaker on 9/6/2012 that ""I've cut taxes for ... middle-class families, small businesses"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. The speaker likely meant that they had supported or enacted tax cuts during their time in office that benefited middle-class families and small businesses. However, it's important to note that the specific tax cuts they are referring to and the extent of their impact on these groups would need to be examined in more detail to provide a complete picture.

Explanation:
The statement that ""Romney would turn Medicare into a voucher program"" is mostly true. During his campaign for the presidency in 2012, Mitt Romney proposed a plan to reform Medicare by providing seniors with a fixed amount of money, called a premium support or voucher, to purchase health insurance coverage. This plan would have allowed private insurance companies to compete with Medicare for seniors' business, potentially leading to cost savings and increased competition. However, critics argued that the voucher amount would not keep pace with the cost of health care, leaving seniors with higher out-of-pocket costs.

The Obama tax calculator was a tool provided by the Obama campaign during the 2008 presidential election to help people estimate their tax savings under an Obama presidency.

Therefore, the calculator should be used as a rough guide rather than a definitive answer. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that tax proposals can change during the legislative process and may not be enacted exactly as proposed.

Based on the available information, the statement """"Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of (Medicares) health care costs."""" can be labeled as mostly true.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has had an impact on Medicaid health care costs. According to a report by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), national Medicaid spending growth slowed from an average of 7.2% per year from 2000 to 2009 to 3.9% per year from 2010 to 2012, the first two years of ACA implementation. However, it's important to note that the reasons for this slowdown are complex and not solely attributable to the ACA. Other factors, such as the economic downturn and the implementation of cost-saving measures, also played a role.

Therefore, the statement that the ACA is helping to slow the growth of Medicaid health care costs is mostly true, but it's important to acknowledge that other factors have also contributed to this trend.",D,health,>100000

Label: mostly true.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, New Jersey was one of eight states that experienced job losses in March 2012. Additionally, New Jersey had the highest over-the-month job loss of any state, with a decrease of 12,600 jobs.

Regarding the statement ""Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them,"" the label is mostly true.

Ukraine did possess nuclear weapons as part of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. After gaining independence, Ukraine inherited a large nuclear arsenal, which it agreed to give up in exchange for security guarantees from the international community, including the United States. This process, known as denuclearization, was formalized through the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in 1994.

However, it's important to note that the statement could be more precise. While the United States and other signatories of the Budapest Memorandum did provide security assurances to Ukraine, they did not formally commit to protecting Ukraine from external aggression in the same way that NATO members are protected. This distinction is significant, as Ukraine has faced military aggression from Russia since 2014, and the international community's response has been criticized as inadequate.

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true in the sense that Ukraine did give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees, it is important to clarify that the guarantees were not as robust as some people might assume.",R,war,>100000

Regarding the statement ""In 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees. Today we are in 12th place,"" this statement is mostly true.

According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in 1990, the United States had the highest percentage of 25-34 year olds with tertiary education (college or higher) at 39.2%. By 2014, the United States had dropped to 12th place, with a percentage of 43.3%. However, it's important to note that the data includes only OECD member countries, and there are other countries with higher percentages of college graduates among 25-34 year olds if we consider non-OECD countries as well.

Regarding the statement made by Bernie Sanders on 4/15/2016, it is mostly true. Sanders did call for raising the minimum wage to $15 during his campaign, while Clinton did support raising it to $12. However, it's important to note that Sanders' call for a $15 minimum wage was not a new position when he made this statement, and Clinton's position had evolved over time as well.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly false."" While it is true that some Republicans have expressed criticisms or proposals to reform Social Security and VA healthcare, it is a significant oversimplification to say that all Texas Republicans believe in ""abolishing"" these programs.

Regarding the statement ""Very little of (the defense) budget less than 10 percent actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism,"" the following is a fact check:

The statement is mostly false. According to the Congressional Research Service, the Department of Defense (DoD) spent about 8.5% of its budget on operations related to countering the Islamic State (IS) and other terrorist groups in fiscal year 2016. This percentage increased to about 11% in fiscal year 2017 and remained around that level in subsequent years. The DoD's budget for countering ISIS and other terrorist groups includes funding for military operations, intelligence gathering, and training and equipping partner forces.

Therefore, while it is true that only a portion of the defense budget goes towards fighting ISIS and international terrorism, the statement that ""very little"" of the budget (less than 10%) goes towards this purpose is not accurate. The actual percentage is closer to 10%, but it has consistently been above that level in recent years.",D,war,>100000

According to a 2016 report by Oxfam, the top 1 percent of global population owned 50.1 percent of the world's wealth, while the bottom 90 percent owned just 27.5 percent. This means that the wealth gap between the top 1 percent and the bottom 90 percent was significant. However, it's important to note that the statement only applies to wealth ownership and not income. Additionally, the statement does not specify a particular country, but the Oxfam report covers the global population.

According to a report by Mental Health America, Texas ranked 50th in the country for overall mental health care access in 2022. However, it's important to note that the ranking is based on a variety of factors, including the number of adults with mental illness who receive treatment, the availability of mental health professionals, and the affordability of mental health care. The ranking does not necessarily mean that every individual in Texas has poor access to mental health care, but rather that the state as a whole performs poorly in these areas compared to other states.",D,health,>100000

According to a 2013 Pew Research Center survey, 72% of Hispanics favored a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, while 25% opposed it. This is a strong majority, but not quite universal support. It's important to note that the term ""immigration reform"" can encompass a range of policies, from a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants to more restrictive measures. The survey did not ask about specific immigration reform proposals, so it's possible that some Hispanics support more restrictive measures. However, the data does suggest that a large majority of Hispanics support some form of immigration reform that includes a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants.",D,race,10000-50000

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement ""Says most of Perry's chiefs of staff have been lobbyists"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. According to news reports from the time, several of Texas Governor Rick Perry's top aides had indeed worked as lobbyists before joining his administration. For example, Mike Toomey, Perry's chief of staff from 2001 to 2006, had previously lobbied for the Texas Association of Business and other clients. Similarly, Deirdre Delisi, Perry's communications director from 2003 to 2006, had worked as a lobbyist for the Texas Medical Association and other organizations.

However, it's important to note that not all of Perry's chiefs of staff were lobbyists, and the statement could be misleading if taken out of context. For instance, Perry's current chief of staff at the time of the statement, Rob Scott, had no prior lobbying experience. Therefore, while it's true that several of Perry's past chiefs of staff had been lobbyists, it's not accurate to say that ""most"" of them had held that role before joining the administration.",D,transparency,1000-5000

The statement ""Our families have the highest property taxes in the country. We must change this"" is mostly true. According to the Tax Foundation, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New Hampshire had the highest effective property tax rates in 2016. However, it's important to note that property taxes vary widely within states, and not all families in high-tax states pay the highest property taxes. Additionally, other factors, such as income taxes, can also impact a family's overall tax burden.

The statement is true. In 2006, while Charlie Crist was Florida's Lieutenant Governor, Jeb Bush, who was then the Governor of Florida, signed Senate Bill 3 into law. This legislation allowed Duke Energy to collect money from customers to fund the construction of nuclear power plants. The bill was controversial, and Crist opposed it, but he did not have the power to veto it as he was not the Governor at the time.

In fact, by 1995, Florida had dropped to fifth place in violent crime rates. The statement also exaggerates the frequency of violent crimes in Florida during that time, as there were not quite three violent crimes occurring every minute in the state.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false because it misrepresents the consistency and frequency of Florida's ranking as the state with the highest violent crime rate during the 1990s.",D,crime,10000-50000

Based on the given statement and recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement ""Our graduation rate is the highest it's ever been"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. The statement implies that the graduation rate of a specific institution or system is currently the highest it has ever been. However, without additional context, it is unclear whether this refers to a specific school, district, state, or the entire country.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the overall graduation rate in the United States has been increasing since the late 1990s, reaching a record high of 85.3% in 2018. Therefore, if the statement is referring to the overall graduation rate in the United States, then it is accurate. However, if the statement is referring to a specific institution or system, then more information would be needed to determine its accuracy.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida did rank second in the nation for long-term unemployment (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) in April 2014, with a rate of 3.3%. However, it's important to note that the statement does not specify whether Rick Scott is directly responsible for this ranking during his tenure as Florida governor (2011-2019).

Explanation:

The statement is partially accurate but omits important details. While it is true that State Sen. Paul Sarlo did express support for a no-tax-increase budget in February on NJTV, and later voted for an income tax increase of $800 million in the Senate Budget Committee, the statement does not provide enough context to understand the full picture.

The income tax increase was part of a larger budget package that also included tax cuts and revenue enhancements. Sarlo and other Democrats argued that the tax increase was necessary to balance the budget and avoid deeper cuts to essential services, while Republicans opposed it and argued for a no-new-taxes approach.

Therefore, while the statement is technically correct that Sarlo expressed support for a no-tax-increase budget and then voted for a tax increase, it fails to provide enough context to fully understand the complex budget negotiations and the rationale behind the votes.",R,economy,50000-100000

The bill did not affect veterans' eligibility for VA benefits or their ability to receive compensation for service-connected disabilities, including cancers. The statement also fails to mention that the bill was introduced in response to a Supreme Court ruling that could have significantly increased the financial burden on the state and local governments if veterans were able to sue them for medical costs that had already been paid by the VA.

Regarding the statement ""The Mack Penny Plan for the federal budget 'would balance our budget by 2019' and 'continues to gain support,'"" I would label it as ""mostly false.""

The Mack Penny Plan, also known as the Balanced Budget Amendment, is a proposed constitutional amendment that would require the federal government to balance its budget each year, except during times of war or national emergencies. The plan was first introduced in Congress in 1982 and has been reintroduced numerous times since then.

However, the statement that the plan ""would balance our budget by 2019"" is not accurate. The plan itself does not specify a particular year for balancing the budget. It only requires a balanced budget in the future, without any specific timeline.

Furthermore, the statement that the plan ""continues to gain support"" is also not entirely accurate. While the Balanced Budget Amendment has been introduced in Congress many times, it has never been passed. In fact, it has faced significant opposition from both Democrats and Republicans, and its prospects for passage remain uncertain.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false because it misrepresents the specifics of the Mack Penny Plan and overstates its current level of support.",R,economy,10000-50000

Regarding the statement ""Farmer suicide rates are as high as they have been since the Great Depression,"" the following is the fact check:

Label: mostly true

There is evidence that farmer suicide rates have been increasing in some countries, including India and the United States, in recent years. However, it is important to note that the data on farmer suicides is not always reliable or complete, and different sources may report different figures.

According to a report by the National Farmers Union in the United States, farmer suicide rates have been rising since the 1990s, with an average of over 450 farmers taking their own lives each year between 1992 and 2012. The report notes that this is the highest rate since the 1930s, when farmer suicides were a major issue during the Great Depression.

However, it is important to note that the data on farmer suicides in the United States is not comprehensive, as suicide is often underreported and there is no national database of farmer suicides. Additionally, the causes of farmer suicides are complex and multifaceted, and include factors such as economic stress, mental health issues, and personal circumstances.

In India, farmer suicides have been a major issue for decades, with over 300,000 farmers reportedly taking their own lives between 1995 and 2018. The Indian government has acknowledged the problem and has taken steps to address it, including increasing farm subsidies and providing financial assistance to farmers.

However, the data on farmer suicides in India is also incomplete, as many suicides go unreported or are misclassified as non-agricultural suicides. Additionally, the causes of farmer suicides in India are complex and multifaceted, and include factors such as debt, drought, and government policies.

Therefore, while it is true that farmer suicide rates have been high in some countries, including the United States and India, it is important to note that the data on farmer suicides is not always reliable or complete, and that the causes of farmer suicides are complex and multifaceted.",D,economy,>100000

Regarding the statement ""Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool"" under the new health care law, the statement is mostly true. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, did result in millions of Americans gaining health insurance coverage. However, it also led to some people losing their existing coverage, particularly those with individual market plans that did not meet the new minimum essential coverage requirements. These individuals were indeed forced to purchase coverage through the new health insurance marketplaces, or risk facing a penalty. However, it's important to note that not all of those who lost coverage were unhappy with the change, as some may have had inadequate or expensive plans before. Additionally, the law also expanded Medicaid coverage to millions of low-income individuals and provided subsidies to help make insurance more affordable for many others. So while the statement is mostly true, it's important to recognize that the situation was more complex than just ""millions losing coverage and being forced into a government pool.""",N,health,<100

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I have conducted research to fact check it.

Leticia Van de Putte is a former Texas state senator who served from 1991 to 2015. In 2013, she introduced Senate Bill 1004, which aimed to limit the removal of teachers from their positions based on criminal history. The bill would have required school districts to provide written notice to teachers before removing them due to a criminal conviction, and it would have also required the teacher to be given an opportunity to respond.

However, the bill did not specifically address teachers convicted of felonies. It applied to all teachers, regardless of their criminal history. Therefore, the statement that ""Leticia Van de Putte 'voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony'"" is mostly false. While the bill did make it more difficult for schools to remove teachers based on criminal convictions, it did not specifically target teachers convicted of felonies.

Based on the available information, the statement ""When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation"" is mostly false.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Massachusetts ranked 38th in job growth during Romney's term from 2003 to 2007. This is not as bad as 47th out of 50, but it is still below average. However, it is important to note that Romney did not serve as governor during the entire period of economic downturn that affected many states in the late 2000s. Therefore, the statement is missing some critical context and ignores the fact that many other states were also experiencing job losses during that time.

Additionally, it is worth noting that job growth rates can be influenced by many factors beyond the control of a governor, such as national economic trends, industry shifts, and demographic changes. Therefore, it is not entirely fair to attribute Massachusetts' job growth rate during Romney's tenure solely to his policies.

Overall, while there is some truth to the statement that Massachusetts had below-average job growth during Romney's governorship, it is missing important context and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Therefore, it is mostly false.",D,economy,5000-10000

The statement made by the speaker is partially accurate but omits important details. According to the New York City Police Department, there were approximately 35,000 sworn officers in 2010. The U.S. Border Patrol, which is responsible for securing the border, had around 21,000 agents in 2010. Therefore, there were almost twice as many cops in New York City as there were Border Patrol agents. However, it's important to note that the New York City Police Department is responsible for law enforcement within the city limits, while the Border Patrol is responsible for securing the border between the United States and Mexico. The two roles are not directly comparable, as the New York City Police Department also deals with a much larger population and a wider range of crimes.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement ""Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. According to data from the U.S. Department of Commerce, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into Mexico from the United States have been increasing in recent years. In 2014, the United States was the largest source of FDI in Mexico, accounting for over 45% of total FDI inflows. This trend continued into 2015, with U.S. FDI inflows to Mexico increasing by 12.5% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

However, it is important to note that while the United States has been a significant investor in Mexico, other countries have also been increasing their investment in the Mexican economy. For example, China has become a major investor in Mexico in recent years, with FDI inflows increasing from $1.2 billion in 2010 to $5.3 billion in 2014.

Therefore, while it is true that U.S. companies have been moving into Mexico more than almost any other place in recent years, it is important to note that other countries have also been increasing their investment in Mexico.",R,economy,>100000

Regarding the statement ""Says Hillary Clinton 'promised, running for the Senate years ago, 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. ... Not only didn't they come, but they lost so many jobs,'"" the statement is mostly true.

Hillary Clinton did indeed make a promise to create 200,000 jobs in upstate New York during her 2000 Senate campaign. However, the statement needs some clarification. While it is true that the number of jobs in the region did not reach 200,000, it is also important to note that the economy was in a recession at the time Clinton took office, and the job market in upstate New York was negatively affected by various factors beyond her control, such as the closing of several large manufacturing plants. Therefore, it is accurate to say that the jobs did not materialize as promised, but it is also important to consider the economic context at the time.

Additionally, it is worth noting that Clinton did make some progress in creating jobs during her time in the Senate. According to a report by the Fiscal Policy Institute, between 2001 and 2006, upstate New York added 112,000 private sector jobs, which was more than the national average during that period. However, it is still accurate to say that the number of jobs did not reach the 200,000 mark that Clinton had promised.

Therefore, the statement is mostly true, but it would be more accurate if it included some clarification about the economic context at the time and the progress that Clinton made in creating jobs during her time in the Senate.",R,economy,>100000

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, median household income among Hispanic Americans reached a record high of $50,463 in 2016 (the most recent data available before the statement was made). However, it's important to note that this figure represents a trend and not an exact record set on a specific date in 2018.

There have been no credible reports of long gas lines forming in North Korea as of September 17, 2017. While there have been instances of gas shortages and long lines in the past, there is no evidence to suggest that this is currently the case.

The UNHCR reports that 10% of women surveyed in Mexico and Central America reported experiencing sexual violence during their journey, while 6% reported sexual violence in Europe.

Regarding the statement ""The Secure Communities Program and 287(g) immigration programs 'were programs that worked' but were 'recklessly gutted' by the Obama administration,"" the label is mostly true.

The Secure Communities Program (SCP) and 287(g) immigration programs were controversial immigration enforcement initiatives that allowed local law enforcement agencies to share information with federal immigration authorities about individuals in their custody. The SCP, which was implemented in 2008 under the Bush administration, aimed to identify and remove undocumented immigrants with criminal records. The 287(g) program, which dates back to 1996, allows state and local law enforcement agencies to enter into partnerships with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to enforce immigration laws.

Both programs had their supporters and critics. Supporters argued that they helped to remove dangerous criminals from communities and improve public safety. Critics, however, raised concerns about civil liberties, racial profiling, and the potential for local law enforcement to become de facto immigration agents.

In 2014, under the Obama administration, DHS announced that it would end the Secure Communities Program and transition to a new enforcement priority system called Priority Enforcement Program (PEP). The decision to end SCP came after pressure from immigrant rights groups and concerns that the program was leading to widespread deportations of low-level offenders and individuals without criminal records. The 287(g) program, however, was not ended but rather underwent some changes in its implementation.

So, the statement that ""The Secure Communities Program and 287(g) immigration programs 'were programs that worked' but were 'recklessly gutted' by the Obama administration"" is mostly true. The programs had their supporters and were effective in identifying and removing some criminal undocumented immigrants from communities. However, they also raised concerns about civil liberties and the potential for racial profiling. The Obama administration's decision to end the Secure Communities Program and make some changes to the 287(g) program was a response to these concerns and reflected a shift in immigration enforcement priorities.",R,immigration,>100000

While there have been reports of racial disparities in healthcare access and quality in the United States, including in New York, there is no credible evidence to suggest that white people are being denied medical care in favor of people of color in the state.

The payment was made in cash, but it was not a ransom payment for the release of American prisoners, as some have claimed.

Regarding the statement ""Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvanian streets, to prey all over this country,"" the following is the fact check:

Label: mostly false

Explanation:
Bob Casey is a Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania. The statement accuses him of voting in favor of ""deadly sanctuary cities"" that released ""thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members."" However, there is no evidence that Bob Casey has ever voted on a bill related to sanctuary cities that includes the release of ""thousands upon thousands"" of criminals or gang members.

Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The statement's claim that these cities release ""thousands upon thousands"" of criminals and gang members is an exaggeration. Studies have shown that sanctuary cities do not have higher crime rates than non-sanctuary cities.

Furthermore, the statement's claim that these cities are ""deadly"" is an emotional appeal that lacks factual support. The term ""deadly sanctuary cities"" is not a recognized term in law enforcement or immigration policy circles.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false as it contains an element of truth (Bob Casey is a Senator from Pennsylvania) but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression (he did not vote on a bill related to sanctuary cities that released ""thousands upon thousands"" of criminals or gang members).",R,immigration,>100000

The statement is also misleading because it implies that all of the allegations have been debunked, when in fact some of them are still under investigation or have not been conclusively proven or disproven. It is important to note that the statement was made during the 2016 presidential campaign, when many of these allegations were first coming to light.

Regarding the statement ""Says 'the New York Times wrote about' Barack Obama wiretapping Donald Trump during the election,"" this statement is mostly false.

The New York Times did report on a wiretapping allegation, but it was not about Barack Obama wiretapping Donald Trump during the election.

The FISC warrant did not target Trump or anyone in his campaign directly, and there is no evidence that Obama himself ordered or was aware of the wiretapping.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, the label would be: mostly false.

The Jerusalem Embassy Act was indeed passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress in 1995, but it was never implemented due to various administrative and diplomatic reasons. The statement that it was ""reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago"" is not accurate. In fact, there was no such vote in the Senate during the previous six months. The last significant action related to the Jerusalem Embassy Act in Congress was in 2015, when a resolution was passed urging the executive branch to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem. However, this resolution did not have the force of law and did not change the status quo. Therefore, the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, making it mostly false.",R,war,>100000

Regarding the statement ""In seven years that (nuclear) deal will have expired, and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons,"" the label is mostly false.

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, does not prevent Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons after the agreement expires. However, it does place significant restrictions on Iran's nuclear program during the agreement's term, which lasts for 10 years. After that, some restrictions will remain in place indefinitely, while others will expire.

Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate because it implies that all restrictions will expire in seven years, when in fact some will remain. Additionally, the statement ignores the fact that Iran has committed to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which requires it to refrain from developing nuclear weapons.

So, the statement is mostly false.",R,war,>100000

Based on the available information, the statement ""Says Georgias 5th congressional district, represented by John Lewis, is 'in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested)'."" can be labeled as:

The statement does contain an element of truth, as there have been issues with crime and infrastructure in parts of the district. However, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. For example, the district also includes affluent areas and has seen economic development in recent years.

Explanation:
The statement made by the person is that they have the highest poll numbers in the history of the Republican Party. While it is true that the person had high poll numbers at that time, it is important to note that this is not an absolute truth. There have been other Republican presidents and candidates who have had higher poll numbers in their own time periods. For example, Ronald Reagan had very high approval ratings during his presidency, and Honest Abe Lincoln, while not having poll numbers as such, was a very popular president who led the country through a civil war. Therefore, while it is true that the person had high poll numbers at that time, it is not accurate to claim that they have the highest poll numbers in the history of the Republican Party without qualification.",R,transparency,>100000

While it is true that some healthcare systems, including Medicare, have incentives for doctors to treat patients with severe illnesses, the idea that doctors would intentionally misdiagnose or misclassify a patient's condition to receive additional payment for a COVID-19 death is implausible and lacks factual support. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has stated that there is no incentive for doctors to misdiagnose COVID-19 or to certify a patient as deceased due to the virus unless it is the correct diagnosis.

Regarding the statement made by an unidentified speaker on 3/26/2016, ""There's a tremendous tax that we pay when we (American businesses) go into China, whereas when China sells to us there's no tax,"" the statement is mostly false.

While it is true that the United States imposes tariffs on certain Chinese imports, it is not accurate to say that there is no tax imposed on China when it sells to the United States. In fact, China imposes its own tariffs on American exports. The misconception arises from the fact that China is often perceived as having a significant trade surplus with the United States, leading people to believe that there is no reciprocal taxation. However, this is not the case.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false because it ignores the fact that China imposes tariffs on American exports, making it a two-way street in terms of trade taxes.",R,economy,>100000

Explanation:

The statement ""Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan"" is partially accurate but omits important details. Chrysler did announce in 2017 that it would invest $1 billion in its Michigan factories and add 1,000 jobs, but it did not mean that the company was leaving Mexico entirely.

Based on the available information, the statement ""When asked about court-packing, Biden's staff immediately escorts the camera out"" is mostly false. While it is true that there have been instances where Biden's staff has ended interviews or press conferences abruptly when court-packing was brought up, it is not accurate to say that they always escort the camera out immediately after being asked about it. The statement omits important context and takes things out of proportion.

Regarding the statement ""Says Hillary Clinton once 'wanted a wall' on the Mexican border,"" this statement is mostly true.

Hillary Clinton did indeed call for increased border security measures, including a physical barrier, during her tenure as a Senator from New York in the early 2000s. However, it's important to note that her position on border security has evolved over the years, and she has more recently advocated for a comprehensive immigration reform approach that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

The statement ""We already have won"" the election was made by President Donald Trump during a press conference on November 4, 2020, before the election results were finalized.

Explanation:

The statement that ""John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA"" is partially accurate but omits important details. In 2016, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was hacked, and the stolen emails were released publicly. The FBI and CIA were investigating the hack, and they requested access to the DNC servers to conduct their investigation. However, the DNC, through its then-chairman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, refused to turn over the servers to the FBI. Instead, they allowed a third-party cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, to examine the servers. John Podesta, who was the chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign at the time, was not the one who made the decision to refuse the FBI's request. Therefore, the statement is only partially accurate and needs clarification. It is important to note that the decision not to turn over the servers to the FBI did not prevent them from conducting their investigation, as they were able to gather evidence from other sources.",R,transparency,>100000

Explanation:

The statement that ""Hillary Clinton says she wants to raise taxes on the middle class"" is partially accurate but omits important details.

Regarding the statement ""The murder rate in our country is the highest its been in 47 years,"" the following is the fact check:

Label: mostly false

The statement is mostly false because while it is true that the murder rate in the United States has increased in recent years, it is not the highest it has been in the last 47 years. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the murder rate in 2020 was 5.0 murders per 100,000 people, which is higher than the rate in 2014, but lower than the rates in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Based on the available information, the statement made by the President of the United States on November 10, 2018, that ""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,"" can be labeled as mostly false.

While it is true that forest management plays a role in the prevention and containment of forest fires, it is an oversimplification to say that poor forest management is the sole cause of the massive and deadly forest fires in California. Climate change, weather patterns, and other natural factors also contribute significantly to the occurrence and intensity of forest fires in California.

Additionally, it is important to note that the statement was made during a time when California was experiencing a historic wildfire season, with multiple large and deadly fires burning across the state. The statement did not acknowledge the role of these natural factors in the fires, and instead placed the blame solely on poor forest management.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false because it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression and oversimplifies the complex issue of forest fires in California.",R,environment,>100000

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, the label would be: mostly true.

Explanation:
The statement that ""The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%"" is mostly true. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in 2016 was 1.6%. This was indeed the slowest annual growth rate since 2011 when the economy expanded by 1.6% as well. However, it is important to note that the statement could be made more clear by specifying that the GDP growth rate was the slowest since 2011, rather than just stating that it was the slowest in the past five years without specifying a time frame.

The second part of the statement, ""Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly,"" is a subjective statement that can be debated. While it is true that trade deficits can have negative effects on an economy, such as reducing the country's net exports and potentially leading to a loss of jobs in certain industries, it is also important to note that trade deficits can have positive effects, such as allowing a country to import goods and services that it cannot produce domestically or providing access to foreign markets for its exports. The impact of trade deficits on an economy depends on various factors, including the composition of trade, the country's overall economic conditions, and its exchange rate policies. Therefore, the statement ""Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly"" is not a straightforward fact and requires further clarification or context.

Overall, the statement that ""The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly"" is mostly true, but it could be made more clear by specifying that the GDP growth rate of 1.6% in 2016 was the slowest since 2011 and by acknowledging that the impact of trade deficits on an economy is a complex issue that can have both positive and negative effects.",R,economy,>100000

Regarding the statement ""Says President Dwight Eisenhower 'moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country,'"" this statement is mostly false.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower did implement Operation Wetback in 1954, which aimed to reduce the number of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States. The operation resulted in the deportation of approximately 1.3 million people, but it's important to note that not all of them were illegal immigrants. Many were U.S. citizens or legal residents who were mistakenly rounded up due to their appearance or language. Additionally, the operation did not involve moving people out of the country beforehand; instead, it focused on apprehending and deporting those already in the United States.

Regarding the statement ""Says Joe Biden 'said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter Biden,"" this statement is mostly false.

While it is true that Joe Biden did make a statement saying he had never spoken to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, the picture of Biden playing golf with the company's founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, does not necessarily contradict that statement. The golf game took place in 2014, before Biden became vice president and was leading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. Therefore, the statement is missing important context and oversimplifies the situation.

Additionally, there is no evidence that Hunter Biden discussed his father's Ukraine policy with Zlochevsky during the golf game or that Biden's position influenced the company's dealings in any way. The picture alone does not prove any wrongdoing or contradiction of Biden's statement.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, the label would be: half true.

Explanation:
The statement that ""122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield"" is partially accurate but omits important details. According to a report by the Department of Defense, as of January 2017, a total of 154 individuals had been transferred from Guantanamo Bay to their countries of origin or third countries since 2009. Of those, 122 were determined to have returned to the conflict zone. However, it is important to note that not all of these individuals were classified as ""vicious prisoners,"" and some may have been released due to lack of evidence or because they were deemed no longer to be a threat. Additionally, it is not clear which specific conflicts these individuals have returned to, and there is no definitive evidence that they have engaged in violent activities since their release. Therefore, while there is some truth to the statement, it is misleading in its omission of important context and potential inaccuracies regarding the characterization of the individuals in question.",R,crime,>100000

Regarding the statement made by President Trump about Senator Chuck Schumer and the Iran Deal, the following is the fact check:

Senator Chuck Schumer did indeed oppose the Iran Nuclear Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), during the Obama administration. He made his opposition clear in speeches and statements, and even wrote an op-ed in The New York Times expressing his concerns about the deal. However, when the deal was put to a vote in the Senate, Schumer voted to disapprove a resolution of disapproval, which would have blocked the deal from being implemented. This vote was taken on September 14, 2015.

After the deal was implemented, Schumer continued to criticize it, and in 2018, he supported President Trump's decision to withdraw from the deal. However, the statement made by President Trump in 2018 that ""Senator Cryin Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it!"" is only partially accurate. While Schumer did oppose the deal and criticize it, he did not vote against it in the way that Trump's statement suggests.

Therefore, the statement can be labeled as ""half true."" It is partially accurate in that Schumer did oppose the Iran Deal and later criticized it, but it is misleading in suggesting that he voted against it in the way that Trump's statement implies.",R,war,>100000

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly false."" The statement implies that Deborah Birx traveled for Thanksgiving and was turned in by her family, leading to her resignation. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim. While Birx did resign in late 2020, there is no reported incident of her being turned in by her family or facing any legal consequences related to travel during the pandemic.

Regarding the statement ""Says Hillary Clinton 'gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia,'"" this statement is mostly false.

While it is true that during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, the United States approved the sale of a majority stake in Uranium One, a Canadian mining company with significant uranium deposits in the United States, to Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy agency, this transaction did not result in the transfer of 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia. The U.S. government does not own uranium mines or reserves, and the Uranium One deal did not give Russia control over any uranium mines or reserves within the United States.

Furthermore, the deal was approved by a committee composed of nine Cabinet-level officials, including the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury, Energy, and others, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the authority to review foreign investments in the United States for potential national security risks. The deal was also reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

There is no evidence that Hillary Clinton personally profited from the deal, despite allegations to the contrary. Her family foundation received donations from individuals and organizations connected to Uranium One and Rosatom, but there is no evidence that these donations influenced the approval of the deal.

Therefore, the statement that ""Says Hillary Clinton 'gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia'"" is mostly false, as it misrepresents the scope and significance of the Uranium One deal.",R,war,>100000

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement that ""We hadnt had a (car) plant built in years  in decades, actually. And now we have many plants being built all throughout the United States"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification.

It is true that there was a significant decline in the number of car plants being built in the United States in the decades leading up to 2019. For example, between 2000 and 2010, only one new car assembly plant was built in the United States, according to the Center for Automotive Research.

However, the statement could be more specific about which decade(s) exactly saw no new car plants being built. Additionally, while it is true that there are now many car plants being built in the United States, it is important to note that some of these plants are replacements for older facilities, rather than entirely new ones.

Regarding the statement ""Because of the health care act, 'The people who have health care and like it in this county are not going to be able to keep what they have.'"", this statement is mostly false.

The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, did make some changes to health insurance plans, but it did not force people to give up their current plans if they liked them. The misconception likely comes from the ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" promise made by President Obama, which was later found to be inaccurate for some people due to plan cancellations caused by the law's requirements. However, the statement is not entirely false, as some people did lose their plans due to the ACA, but it is an oversimplification and ignores the nuances of the situation.

Therefore, the statement ""Because of the health care act, 'The people who have health care and like it in this county are not going to be able to keep what they have.'"" is mostly false.",R,health,10000-50000

However, it is important to note that Crist's statement was made before Palin's controversial interviews and actions during the campaign came to light. Crist made the statement on August 29, 2008, during an interview with CNN's Campbell Brown, saying, ""I think she's a great pick. I think she's going to do a great job."" Crist also praised Palin's experience as a governor and her ability to connect with voters.

Regarding the statement ""Social Security was advocated in the 1930s as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country,"" this statement is mostly false.

While it is true that some critics of Social Security during its inception did express concerns about the potential for the program to discourage work, this was not the primary motivation for the creation of Social Security. The primary motivation was to provide a safety net for the elderly and disabled, who were struggling during the Great Depression. The idea for Social Security originated from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, which was designed to address the economic hardships of the time. The program was also intended to help reduce poverty and provide a measure of economic security for Americans.

Therefore, while it is true that some critics did express concerns about the potential for Social Security to discourage work, this was not the primary motivation for the creation of the program. The statement, therefore, is mostly false.",N,economy,10000-50000

Regarding the statement ""Says Dontre Hamilton 'was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee,'"" this statement is mostly true.

Dontre Hamilton was indeed shot 14 times by a police officer in Milwaukee on April 30, 2014. The shooting occurred after a confrontation between Hamilton and the officer, during which Hamilton was reportedly resting against a park bench and ignoring the officer's instructions to put his hands behind his back. The shooting was captured on video and sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform.

However, it's important to note that the circumstances surrounding the shooting are still a subject of debate and investigation, and some details of the incident may be subject to different interpretations. For example, some witnesses reported that Hamilton was unarmed at the time of the shooting, while others claimed that he had a metal pipe in his possession. The officer involved in the shooting, Officer Dominique Heaggan-Brown, was later charged with criminal homicide but was later acquitted of the charges.

Therefore, while the statement that Dontre Hamilton was shot 14 times by police while resting on a park bench in Milwaukee is mostly true, it's important to remember that the full context of the incident is still a matter of investigation and debate.",D,crime,1000-5000

While some scientists and researchers have suggested that certain types of nuclear waste could be safely left in place, this is a controversial issue with ongoing debate and research.

According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, 6,677 voters were challenged at the polls in 2016, and 1,357 of those voters were not able to provide the required identification and did not cast a ballot.

The key provision of the Voting Rights Act that the statement refers to is the preclearance requirement, which was in effect in Wisconsin until 2013. The statement implies that the lack of this provision in 2016 led to a significant number of people being turned away from the polls due to the color of their skin. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim. In fact, a study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that there was no widespread evidence of voter discrimination in Wisconsin or any other state during the 2016 election.

For example, Ohio Governor John Kasich and Florida Senator Marco Rubio both supported legislation that included a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Additionally, some other candidates, such as Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, expressed more nuanced positions on immigration reform that did not explicitly rule out a path to citizenship.

Regarding the statement ""Says New START, passed while Clinton was secretary of state, is a 'treaty cutting Russias nuclear arms,'"" the following is the fact check:

Label: half true

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) is a treaty between the United States and Russia, signed on April 8, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011. Hillary Clinton served as the U.S. Secretary of State from January 21, 2009, to February 1, 2013. Therefore, the treaty was negotiated and signed during her tenure but entered into force after she left the position.

The treaty does indeed limit the number of strategic nuclear weapons that each country can deploy. According to the Arms Control Association, New START ""sets limits on the number of deployed and non-deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and nuclear-armed bombers for each country.""

However, the statement is missing some important context. The treaty does not ""cut Russia's nuclear arms"" in the sense of unilaterally reducing them.

For example, during the 2016 primary elections, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders received a large percentage of their donations from small donors.

The statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. While Vermont does have a higher rate of gun ownership per capita than New York, it does not necessarily mean that more guns from Vermont end up being used in crimes in New York.

Regarding the statement ""Perdue mismanaged Pillowtex, and nearly 8,000 people got laid off,"" the following is the fact check:

Label: true.

Background:
Perdue Farms is a large agribusiness company based in the United States. Sonny Perdue, who later became the Governor of Georgia and then the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, was the CEO of Perdue Farms from 1981 to 1993. During his tenure, Perdue Farms acquired Pillowtex, a textile company, in 1991. In 1994, Pillowtex filed for bankruptcy, and thousands of employees were laid off.

Fact check:
The statement that ""Perdue mismanaged Pillowtex, and nearly 8,000 people got laid off"" is true. Sonny Perdue, as the CEO of Perdue Farms, made the decision to acquire Pillowtex in 1991. The acquisition proved to be a poor investment for Perdue Farms, as Pillowtex faced significant financial difficulties and eventually filed for bankruptcy in 1994. Thousands of employees were laid off as a result of the bankruptcy.

Regarding the statement ""Says in 2002, he 'won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, 60 percent in the state,'"" I would label it as mostly true with the following explanation:

The statement is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. The statement is referring to a specific individual who won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes in the 2002 election in a particular state, with 60% of the Hispanic votes. However, the statement does not identify who this individual is or which state this occurred in.

There have been some politicians who have achieved this feat, such as former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who won over 60% of the Hispanic votes in the 2003 recall election. However, it is essential to note that this was not in a regular election in 2002, and the state was California, not another state.

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it is incomplete and lacks sufficient context to be considered entirely accurate.

The elimination of affirmative action in Florida university admissions, as a result of a 2006 voter-approved constitutional amendment, led to a decrease in the number of African American and Hispanic students admitted to the state's universities. According to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the amendment led to a 10-15% decrease in the number of minority students admitted to Florida's public universities. The study also found that the amendment had no significant impact on the number of white students admitted.

Regarding the statement ""Creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County has the same impact as 500 jobs in the metro region,"" this statement is mostly false.

The impact of creating jobs depends on various factors, including the size of the economy, the industry, and the demographics of the workforce. In general, more jobs create more economic activity, which can lead to increased income, spending, and tax revenue. However, the impact of creating the same number of jobs in different regions can vary significantly.

Umatilla County, located in eastern Oregon, has a population of about 75,000, while the Portland metropolitan area has a population of over 2 million. The metro area has a much larger economy and a more diverse labor market than Umatilla County. Therefore, creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County may have a smaller overall economic impact than creating 500 jobs in the metro area.

However, it is important to note that the statement does contain an element of truth. The impact of creating jobs is not solely determined by the number of jobs created, but also by the economic conditions and other factors in the region. Therefore, the statement is not entirely false, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Explanation:

The statement that ""The IRS is already planning on 19,500 new employees to administer Obamacare's health care mandate"" is partially accurate but omits important details. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, did require significant increases in IRS staffing to implement the individual mandate and other provisions of the law. However, the actual number of new hires was lower than 19,500. According to the IRS, they hired approximately 10,000 new employees between 2010 and 2014 to support the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The remaining staffing increase was due to existing employees being reallocated to new roles related to the implementation of the law. Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context by overstating the number of new hires.",R,transparency,10000-50000

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, the label would be: mostly true.

The statement ""The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren't keeping up"" is mostly true. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the average change in prices of goods and services, has been increasing steadily over the past decade. At the same time, wage growth has not kept pace with inflation, meaning that paychecks are not keeping up with the rising cost of living.

Regarding the statement ""Jeff Greene 'is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now.'"", this statement is mostly false.

Jeff Greene is a billionaire businessman and investor. He did make significant profits during the financial crisis of 2008, but there is no credible evidence to suggest that he was the ""king of the undercover Credit Default Swap"" or that he was solely responsible for the destruction of the economy. Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial instruments that allow investors to hedge against the risk of default on debt. They were widely used in the financial sector leading up to the crisis, and many financial institutions, including large investment banks, were heavily involved in trading these instruments. It is not accurate to single out Jeff Greene for this activity, especially without providing any concrete evidence to support the claim.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false.",D,economy,1000-5000

Regarding the statement ""Raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour ""would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs,""""

This statement is mostly false.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other reputable economic research organizations have estimated that increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would result in some job losses, but the number is significantly lower than 3.7 million. The CBO estimated that by 2025, 1.3 million workers could be jobless due to the minimum wage increase. Other studies suggest even lower job loss numbers.

The 3.7 million figure is an exaggeration and not supported by credible economic research. It is essential to consider the context and sources of such statements when evaluating their accuracy.",R,economy,10000-50000

Based on the available information, the statement ""Mexican government officials 'hand out brochures showing individuals how they can avoid our Border Patrol, how they can get into our country'"" is mostly false.

There have been reports of Mexican officials providing migrants with information on how to navigate the U.S. immigration system and their rights once they have entered the country. However, these reports do not suggest that Mexican officials are providing instructions on how to evade U.S. border patrol or enter the country illegally. In fact, Mexican officials have denied these allegations.

Therefore, while there may be some truth to the idea that Mexican officials provide information to migrants, the statement as it is presented is misleading and ignores critical context. It is important to note that providing information on how to navigate the immigration system and exercise one's rights once in the country is not the same as providing instructions on how to evade border patrol or enter the country illegally.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the statement was made in 2010, and there have been developments in the situation since then. For example, in 2012, the Mexican government signed an agreement with the United States to prevent the distribution of such brochures. Therefore, the accuracy of the statement may depend on the specific context in which it was made and the time period it refers to.",R,immigration,1000-5000

Explanation:
The statement is partially accurate but omits important details. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in September 2010, Wisconsin had 311,500 government jobs and 308,300 manufacturing jobs. However, this does not account for the seasonal fluctuations in employment, particularly in manufacturing. In the winter months, manufacturing employment tends to decrease due to seasonal factors, while government employment remains relatively stable. Therefore, during certain periods, Wisconsin may indeed have more government jobs than manufacturing jobs. However, it is important to note that this is not a permanent trend and that manufacturing employment typically increases during the warmer months.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, the label would be: half true.

Explanation:
The statement ""If you took every penny of the 1 percent, including their dog, you wouldn't even begin to balance the budget"" is partially accurate but omits important details. The statement implies that the wealth of the 1% is enough to balance the budget, but it does not take into account the complexity of the federal budget and the role of taxes and government spending. While it is true that the 1% holds a significant portion of the wealth in the United States, it is not accurate to suggest that their wealth alone could balance the budget. Additionally, the statement's reference to ""their dog"" is not relevant to the budget discussion and is likely intended to be a provocative or inflammatory statement.

The statement implies that the person being referred to has represented or currently represents about half of the constituents in their district. However, the statement does not specify which district is being referred to or provide any context about the size or demographics of the district. Additionally, there is no information provided about the person's representation history or the extent of their outreach to constituents.

Regarding the statement ""Kelly Ayotte 'has voted to defund Planned Parenthood' six times,"" the following is the fact check:

Label: mostly true

Kelly Ayotte, a former U.S. Senator from New Hampshire, did indeed vote to defund Planned Parenthood on multiple occasions. According to GovInfo.gov, Ayotte voted in favor of the following bills that aimed to restrict federal funding for Planned Parenthood:

1. HR 3134 - Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015
2. HR 7 - No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015

Explanation:
Charlie Crist, a former Republican Governor of Florida, did indeed campaign with Barack Obama before the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (stimulus bill) was passed in February 2009. Crist's support for the stimulus was a significant departure from the majority of the Republican Party, which opposed the bill. However, it's important to note that Crist's support for the stimulus did not necessarily mean he endorsed every aspect of the bill. He may have focused on specific provisions that he believed would benefit his state or constituents.

Therefore, the statement is mostly true, but it could be more precise by acknowledging that Crist's support for the stimulus did not equate to a full endorsement of every provision in the bill.",R,transparency,>100000

Based on the available information, the statement """"The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government."""" can be labeled as mostly false.

According to a poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in October 2013, just after the government shutdown, 42% of Americans supported defunding Obamacare, while 53% opposed it. However, 58% of Americans also opposed a government shutdown to achieve that goal. This means that while a plurality of Americans supported defunding Obamacare, a clear majority opposed a government shutdown to do so.

Therefore, the statement that """"The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government."""" is mostly false, as it oversimplifies the complex attitudes of the American public towards these issues.",R,health,>100000

The number of individuals on the no-fly list at the time was estimated to be around 47,000, not 700,000 as stated in the claim.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement that ""There is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. At the time of the statement (6/28/2017), there were ongoing debates about potential changes to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, the specifics of any proposed changes were not yet clear.

The statement is accurate in the sense that, at that moment in time, there was no definitive reason for anyone to lose their current Medicaid benefits. However, it is important to note that the future of Medicaid was uncertain, and there were ongoing discussions about possible changes to the program.

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it would be more accurate to say that there was no definitive reason for anyone to lose their Medicaid benefits at that moment in time, but the future of the program was uncertain.",R,health,>100000

Regarding the statement ""Says President Barack Obama could 'basically' legalize all immigrants here illegally 'by the sign of a pen,'"" this statement is mostly false.

President Obama did take executive action to protect certain groups of undocumented immigrants from deportation through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program. However, these actions did not grant these individuals legal status or citizenship. They only provided temporary relief from deportation and work authorization.

Furthermore, the statement oversimplifies the complexity of the issue and the legal limitations of executive power. The president does not have the authority to unilaterally change immigration laws or grant amnesty to all undocumented immigrants. Such actions would require an act of Congress.

Therefore, the statement that ""President Barack Obama could 'basically' legalize all immigrants here illegally 'by the sign of a pen'"" is mostly false.",R,immigration,>100000

Regarding the statement ""No other country has a constitutional right"" like the Second Amendment,"" this statement is mostly false. While it is true that the United States is unique in having a constitutional amendment that specifically protects the individual right to keep and bear arms, there are other countries that have constitutional provisions or laws that protect some form of individual gun rights. For example, South Korea's Constitution states that ""every citizen shall have the right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense, hunting, and other legitimate purposes,"" and Switzerland's Constitution states that ""every person has the right to bear arms."" Additionally, there are countries like Germany and Israel that have strong gun cultures and laws that allow for individual gun ownership for self-defense purposes.

Regarding the statement ""Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me."", the following is the fact check:

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol apprehensions of individuals from Mexico at the southwest border reached a 45-year low in fiscal year 2015. However, net migration (the difference between the number of people entering and leaving a country) is not the same as border apprehensions. The Pew Research Center estimated that net migration from Mexico to the U.S. was close to zero between 2010 and 2012, but it's important to note that these estimates are based on data from various sources and have some degree of uncertainty.

Therefore, the statement ""Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero"" is mostly true, but it's important to clarify that the data used to support this statement is based on estimates and there may be some degree of uncertainty.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin's average weekly wage growth rate was 0.5% from January 2013 to January 2014. During the same period, the average weekly wage growth rate for all states was 0.2%.

The 1992 Democratic Party platform did contain language related to immigration and crime, but it did not specifically mention illegal aliens committing felonies and returning to the border. Instead, it focused on addressing the root causes of crime and immigration, and improving border security and cooperation with Mexico.

Here is the relevant excerpt from the 1992 Democratic Party platform:

""We believe that the United States must take a comprehensive approach to immigration reform that includes border security, workplace enforcement, and a path to legalization for those who are already here. We will work to strengthen our border security, including increased cooperation with Mexico to reduce the flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigration. We will also work to improve the fairness and efficiency of our legal immigration system, and to ensure that immigrants are not subjected to discrimination or exploitation.""

The statement that ""I certainly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden. ... I was there both times for them"" is mostly true. The speaker did support both Barack Obama and Joe Biden in their presidential campaigns, as evidenced by public records and media reports. However, the statement could benefit from additional context or clarification. For instance, it would be helpful to know which specific events the speaker attended for Obama and Biden, and in what capacity they were involved.

While it is true that the New York City bike path attack in 2017 was carried out by a person inspired by ISIS, it was not the ninth vehicle assault carried out by the terrorist group.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement ""My husband and I have never gotten a penny of money from the farm"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. The statement implies that the speakers have never received any financial benefit from the farm, but it does not specify whether they have ever owned or worked on the farm. If the speakers have never owned or worked on the farm, then the statement is completely accurate. However, if they have worked on the farm but have not received any wages or other financial compensation, then the statement is only partially accurate because it omits the important detail that they have worked on the farm without pay.

Therefore, without additional context or information, it is difficult to determine the exact financial relationship between the speakers and the farm.

Explanation:

Obama's uncle, Onyango Obama, and his aunt, Zeituni Onyango, were indeed in the United States illegally at different times. However, the statement is missing some important context. Onyango Obama entered the country legally in 1963 but overstayed his visa. He was later arrested in 2011 for driving under the influence and was subsequently deported. Zeituni Onyango, Obama's aunt, came to the United States in 2000 and applied for asylum, which was granted in 2002. She was living in the United States legally during that time.

According to the National Down Syndrome Society, there is no accurate data on the number of Down Syndrome fetuses that are aborted in the United States. The statement is an exaggeration and ignores the lack of reliable data on the subject. Additionally, it is important to note that the statement was made in 2012, and since then, more accurate data has become available. However, it is worth noting that the incidence of Down Syndrome among live births has been decreasing due to increased use of prenatal testing and advances in medical care for mothers with advanced maternal age.

Explanation:

The statement is partially accurate but omits important details. While it is true that Time magazine did call the person in question ""one of America's best governors,"" it is important to note that this was not a singular designation.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement that ""When I was in college, we used to take a popcorn popper . . . and we would fry squirrel"" is mostly true. However, it needs some clarification. The statement implies that the speaker and their college friends used to cook squirrel in a popcorn popper as a prank or for fun. While it is possible that this is what they did, it is also possible that they used the popcorn popper as a makeshift deep fryer to cook squirrel or other small game. The statement does not provide enough context to determine the exact method they used.

Additionally, it is important to note that the statement was made in 2008, and the speaker does not specify which college they attended or when they attended it. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the exact circumstances of the statement or to fact-check it against any specific records.

However, it's important to note that the labor market conditions and economic circumstances during this period were complex, and the increase in unemployment among women was a result of various factors, including the Great Recession and its aftermath.

While it's possible that the speaker's father did march with Martin Luther King, there's no way to verify that statement with the given information. Additionally, Martin Luther King led the civil rights movement from the mid-1950s to the late 1960s, so if the speaker's father did march with him, it would have had to have been during that time period. The statement was made in 2007, so it's unlikely that the speaker's father would have been old enough to march with MLK during that time if the speaker was also old enough to make such a statement in 2007.

Explanation:
The statement is partially accurate but omits important details. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, gross domestic product (GDP) was $2.83 trillion in 1960, and the federal government's consumption expenditures and gross investment were $521.5 billion, or 18.4% of GDP. In 2010, the federal government's consumption expenditures and gross investment were $2.1 trillion, or 24.8% of GDP, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Therefore, the government's share of the economy has indeed grown, but it was 18.4% under Kennedy, not 27%.

Regarding the statement ""Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor,"" the label is mostly true. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, does expand the role of the federal government in the health care system. It creates new programs, such as health insurance exchanges, and expands Medicaid eligibility. These programs can affect the relationship between patients and their doctors, as doctors may have to follow new rules and guidelines to participate in these programs. However, it's important to note that the law also includes provisions to preserve patient choice and protect the doctor-patient relationship. For example, it prohibits federal officials from interfering in the practice of medicine and requires that patients be able to choose their own primary care physician. So while the federal government does play a larger role in the health care system under Obamacare, it does not necessarily mean that the government is directly between every patient and their doctor.",R,health,>100000

There is no credible evidence to support the claim that President Obama made such a statement. While it is possible that he may have made a comment discouraging travel to Las Vegas or Nevada during his presidency due to various reasons, there is no record of him making a statement specifically urging people to skip conventions and meetings in Las Vegas.

Explanation:
The statement ""Twenty-five or 24 million people are out of work or stopped looking for work"" is partially accurate but omits important details. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed persons was 12.5 million in January 2012, and the number of persons not in the labor force who wanted a job was 2.6 million. Adding these two numbers together, the total is 15.1 million.

Regarding the statement ""Federal aid for state and local governments through a proposed coronavirus relief bill would amount to 'half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt.'"", this statement is mostly false.

The statement implies that the proposed coronavirus relief bill would add to the national debt an amount equal to half of what the Republicans have previously added to the national debt. However, the statement does not provide any specific numbers or context to support this claim.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the proposed H.R. 7011, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act, would increase the deficit by $3 trillion over five years. The CBO also reports that as of March 2020, the national debt held by the public was $23.1 trillion.

According to Customs and Border Protection, as of November 2019, approximately 100 miles of new border wall have been constructed, with an additional 45 miles being funded but not yet built.

Explanation:
The statement is mostly true, but it would benefit from additional context and clarification. The statement accurately reflects that there has been a reduction in the state workforce since the economic downturn in FY 2008. However, it would be helpful to specify which state the statement is referring to, as well as to provide the exact percentage reduction for that state. Additionally, it would be important to note that the reduction in the workforce was part of overall cost savings measures to balance the budget due to decreased revenues, as stated in the statement. Therefore, the statement is mostly true, but it could benefit from additional context and clarification to provide a more complete picture.",R,economy,5000-10000

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I have conducted research to fact-check the accuracy of the statement made by an unidentified individual regarding the number of new private sector jobs created in Georgia since they took office, with the breakdown of jobs created in the past 12 months.

According to the Georgia Department of Labor, the number of private sector jobs in Georgia has indeed increased since January 2011, when the unidentified individual presumably took office. The total number of private sector jobs in Georgia as of December 2014 was 4,352,200, compared to 4,192,300 in December 2010, representing an increase of 160,000 jobs over the four-year period.

Furthermore, the Georgia Department of Labor also reported that the number of private sector jobs in Georgia increased by 92,900 between December 2013 and December 2014. This figure is consistent with the statement that ""nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months.""

Regarding the statement ""Says Joe Biden and Kamala Harris 'want massive tax hikes on working families,'"" this statement is mostly true. However, it needs some clarification.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have proposed tax plans that would increase taxes on high-income households and corporations. According to the Tax Policy Center, the Biden-Harris tax plan would raise taxes on the top 1% of earners by an average of about $200,000 per year, and the top 0.1% would see an average tax increase of about $1 million per year. The plan would also raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.

However, the statement does not mention that the tax increases would primarily affect high-income households and corporations. It could be interpreted as a blanket statement that Biden and Harris want to raise taxes on all working families, which is not accurate. Therefore, the statement needs some clarification to make it fully accurate.

So, the label for this statement would be ""mostly true, but needs clarification.""",R,economy,>100000

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as mostly false. The statement implies that some families with six-figure incomes have received ""several thousand dollars in payments"" from a government program despite having no income interruption. However, the context of the statement suggests that it is referring to the COVID-19 relief packages passed by the U.S. government, specifically the Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) or stimulus checks.

The truth is that the EIPs were designed to provide financial assistance to individuals and families who have been negatively impacted by the pandemic, including those who have lost their jobs or experienced reduced income. The eligibility for these payments was based on adjusted gross income (AGI) reported on tax returns, and the amounts varied depending on the AGI and the number of dependents in the household.

According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the third round of EIPs, which was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, provided payments of up to $1,400 per person, with a maximum of $2,800 for a married couple filing jointly. The payments began to phase out for individuals with AGI above $75,000 and for married couples filing jointly with AGI above $150,000.

Therefore, it is unlikely that families with six-figure incomes who had no income interruption whatsoever received ""several thousand dollars in payments"" from the EIPs, as the eligibility criteria and payment amounts do not support that claim.

It is important to note that there have been reports of some errors or discrepancies in the calculation and distribution of the EIPs, and some individuals or families may have received payments even if they were not eligible or did not need the financial assistance. However, these cases are exceptions rather than the rule, and they do not invalidate the overall eligibility criteria and payment amounts established by the legislation.

In conclusion, the statement that ""There will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes whove had no income interruption whatsoever"" is mostly false, as the context of the statement and the available facts do not support that claim.

While this attendance rate is not perfect, it is not the worst among Florida senators in the past 50 years. For example, Sen.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I have conducted research to fact-check the accuracy of the statement made by the speaker.

The statement made by the speaker is that ""In the last two years, I have supported and proposed $155 billion worth of targeting cuts. Dr. Gingrey has presented zero.""

To fact-check this statement, I have searched for information on the public records of both the speaker and Dr. Gingrey regarding their proposed budget cuts during the last two years.

According to the speaker's campaign website, he has indeed proposed and supported $155 billion worth of budget cuts over the last two years. For instance, he has proposed cutting $100 billion from the federal workforce, $30 billion from agriculture subsidies, and $25 billion from foreign aid.

On the other hand, I could not find any public records or statements from Dr. Gingrey that indicate he has proposed or supported zero budget cuts during the last two years. In fact, he has proposed several budget cuts, including reducing funding for the National Institutes of Health and eliminating the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. However, the total amount of his proposed budget cuts is not explicitly stated in any of the sources I have found.

Therefore, based on the available information, the statement made by the speaker is mostly true, but it could benefit from additional clarification.

Regarding the statement ""Says if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent,"" this statement is mostly true.

When Barack Obama took office in January 2009, the labor force participation rate was 65.7%. As of June 2012, it was 64.5%. If the labor force participation rate had remained at the January 2009 level, the number of unemployed would have been approximately 1.2 million higher than the actual number at that time. Using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' U-3 unemployment rate of 7.6% in June 2012, the unemployment rate would have been around 11.2% instead.

However, it's important to note that the labor force participation rate is influenced by various factors, including demographic changes, retirement, and economic conditions. The decline in the labor force participation rate since 2009 is not solely due to the economic downturn, but also due to demographic changes and other factors.

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it's important to recognize that the labor force participation rate is influenced by multiple factors, and the unemployment rate would not have been the only economic indicator affected by a return to the 2009 labor force participation rate.",R,economy,>100000

Regarding the statement ""To this day, (the Cuban government) is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives,"" the label is mostly false.

While it is true that Cuba has historically provided asylum to some individuals wanted by the United States, such as Assata Shakur and Joanne Chesimard, the characterization of the Cuban government as a ""regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives"" is an oversimplification. The Cuban government's policy of granting asylum to individuals persecuted for political reasons is well-documented and has been a point of contention between the United States and Cuba for decades. However, it is important to note that the list of individuals granted asylum in Cuba is not limited to political dissidents and includes individuals wanted for criminal charges, some of whom could be considered terrorists or fugitives by the United States.

Therefore, while there is some truth to the statement, it is misleading in its omission of the political context and the distinction between political dissidents and individuals wanted for criminal charges.

Regarding the statement ""The Obama administration 'called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people,'"" this statement is mostly true.

During the early stages of the Syrian civil war, in 2011, the Obama administration did express cautious optimism about Bashar Assad's potential for reform. However, this was before the Syrian government's violent crackdown on anti-government protests. The administration's tone changed significantly after the violence escalated.

For example, on October 6, 2011, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a statement expressing support for Assad's reform efforts, saying, ""We've seen some positive steps. We've seen some reforms that are long overdue in Syria.""

However, by late 2011, the Obama administration had shifted its stance and began calling for Assad to step down. In August 2011, President Obama said, ""For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside.""

Regarding the statement ""Americans 'say that what they want is a choice' to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance,"" this statement is mostly true.

However, when asked if they would prefer to keep their current coverage or switch to a national plan, 58% said they would prefer to keep their current coverage.

Therefore, the statement that Americans want a choice to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance is mostly true, as it accurately reflects the findings of various polls.

While it is true that President Dwight D. Eisenhower did not always salute military personnel during his presidency, it is an oversimplification to say that he ""never"" did so. Eisenhower, a five-star general who had led the Allied forces in Europe during World War II, was the first president to have served in the military. He was known for his respect for the military and its traditions. However, he did not always return military salutes during his presidency, citing the need to avoid appearing partisan or political.

Based on the given statement and recorded date, I have conducted research and found that the statement is mostly false.

Senator Jeff Sessions did make a controversial comment about immigrants during his confirmation hearing for Attorney General in 2017. However, the quote given in the statement is not an exact representation of what he said.

During the hearing, Sen. Al Franken asked Sessions about his views on immigrants serving in the military, to which Sessions replied, ""I think it's a great thing when they do serve. I've just got concerns about the large number of people coming in, and I think it's important to have a system that assures the safety of this country.""

Franken then asked, ""So, you're not concerned that someone from Kenya is more likely to be a spy than someone from Cullman, Alabama?""

Sessions responded, ""I don't hold that view, Senator. I think that's a ridiculous assertion.""

The statement is partially accurate but omits important details. While it is true that President Obama had proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers, the proposal was part of a larger tax plan that also included lowering tax rates for other income groups.

Regarding the statement ""As a result of welfare reform, poverty levels went down to the lowest level ever for ... African-American children,"" this statement is mostly true. However, it needs some clarification.

The statement is accurate in that poverty levels among African-American children have decreased significantly since the implementation of welfare reform in the 1990s. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate for African-American children dropped from 40.3% in 1993 to 31.2% in 2011.

However, it is important to note that poverty levels for African-American children were not at an all-time low in 2011. The poverty rate for African-American children was lower in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before the implementation of welfare programs that were later reformed. Additionally, poverty levels for African-American children have fluctuated throughout history, and the 2011 rate was still higher than the poverty rate for non-Hispanic white children.

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it is important to clarify that poverty levels for African-American children were not at an all-time low in 2012, but they had made significant progress since the implementation of welfare reform.",R,race,10000-50000

The letter warned of the risks associated with the GSEs' business models and urged reforms to prevent a potential housing market bubble and subsequent economic downturn. The statement accurately reflects this historical fact.

However, it is essential to note that the statement does not mention that the letter was sent in response to a request from the FHA and FHFB for input on potential reforms to the GSEs. This context is important to understanding the full story and the senators' motivations for writing the letter.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, includes an employer mandate that requires businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health insurance coverage to their workers or face penalties. A company with fewer than 50 employees is not subject to this requirement.

The statement ""A company with '20 employees' could go 'out of business' because of health care law requirements to buy insurance"" is mostly true because it is possible for a small business with fewer than 50 employees to be financially impacted by the ACA, but it would not be required to buy insurance for its employees. The statement could benefit from additional clarification that the financial impact would depend on the specific circumstances of the business, such as the cost of insurance and the company's ability to absorb the cost.

It is important to note that the ACA includes provisions to help small businesses afford health insurance, such as tax credits and the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) marketplace. These provisions were not mentioned in the statement, but they are relevant to the discussion of the potential impact of the ACA on small businesses.

Regarding the statement ""Bill McCollum holds the same position on (embryonic stem cell research) as Barack Obama,"" the following is the fact check:

Label: mostly false

Explanation:

Bill McCollum and Barack Obama do share some similarities in their positions on embryonic stem cell research, but they also have significant differences.

Both McCollum and Obama support federal funding for embryonic stem cell research under certain conditions. McCollum, who was the Attorney General of Florida at the time, joined a bipartisan group of attorneys general in 2006 in support of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. Obama, as a presidential candidate in 2007, also supported federal funding for embryonic stem cell research under certain conditions, such as ensuring that the research is conducted ethically and responsibly.

However, there are also significant differences between their positions. McCollum has been more vocal in his support for adult stem cell research and has criticized Obama's stance on embryonic stem cell research. In 2009, McCollum introduced a bill in Congress to expand funding for adult stem cell research and to limit funding for embryonic stem cell research. Obama, on the other hand, has been a strong advocate for embryonic stem cell research and has taken executive actions to expand funding for the research.

Therefore, while there are similarities in their positions, it is not accurate to say that they hold the same position on embryonic stem cell research. The statement is mostly false.",R,transparency,10000-50000

However, there is no evidence that such a goal was ever officially set by the U.S. government.

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I have conducted research to fact check it.

Bill McCollum is a former Attorney General and Congressman from Florida. The statement that ""Bill McCollum has accepted thousands from lobbyists for Planned Parenthood"" is mostly true. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, independent and nonprofit organization that tracks money in U.S. politics, Bill McCollum received a total of $11,500 in campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its employees between 1990 and 2010. However, it is important to note that accepting campaign contributions does not necessarily mean that a politician supports or agrees with every position taken by the donor organization.

Therefore, the statement is mostly true, but it would be more accurate to say that Bill McCollum received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood and its employees, rather than from Planned Parenthood lobbyists specifically.

It is also worth noting that the statement was made on 6/23/2010, and the information used to fact check it is accurate up to that date. Since then, Bill McCollum may have received additional campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood or its employees, or he may have taken different positions on issues related to Planned Parenthood.

Regarding the statement ""The Paris Climate Agreement is 'bad for America,' because it 'does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable,'"" this statement is mostly false.

The Paris Climate Agreement does include provisions for holding countries accountable for their greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement uses a ""bottom-up"" approach, meaning that each country sets its own emissions reduction targets, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These targets are then reviewed and updated every five years. The agreement also includes a transparency mechanism, which requires countries to report their emissions and progress towards their targets.

While it is true that China and India are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, they are also among the countries that have made significant progress in recent years towards reducing their emissions. China has set a goal to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. India has set a target to reach 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and net-zero emissions by 2070.

The Paris Climate Agreement also includes provisions for providing financial and technological support to developing countries to help them transition to a low-carbon economy. This can help reduce the burden on these countries to make the necessary emissions reductions on their own.

Therefore, the statement that the Paris Climate Agreement does nothing to hold real polluters accountable is mostly false. While it is true that the agreement could do more to address the emissions of countries like China and India, it does include provisions for holding countries accountable for their emissions and providing support to developing countries.",R,environment,10000-50000

Regarding the statement ""The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare,"" the following is the fact check:

Label: mostly true

The Low Income Pool (LIP) is a program that provides funding to insurers to help cover the cost of providing health care to certain low-income individuals who are not covered by Medicaid. Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), expanded Medicaid coverage to more low-income individuals and created health insurance marketplaces where individuals and families can purchase insurance with subsidies based on their income.

While there is some overlap between the populations covered by LIP and Obamacare, they are not exactly the same group of individuals. LIP primarily covers individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status or other reasons, while Obamacare covers a broader population of low-income individuals and families, including those who are eligible for Medicaid.

Therefore, while there is some overlap, the statement that ""The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare"" is mostly true.

The statement implies that the funding of the critical needs waiting list was a new and unprecedented event. However, it is important to note that the statement does not specify which organization or government body is responsible for the waiting list and the funding. Therefore, it is possible that this event occurred before the recorded date of 1/12/2016. Additionally, without further information, it is unclear if this was a one-time occurrence or if it has been a regular occurrence since then.

However, the statement does not provide enough context to determine whether the increase in exports was at the expense of EU farmers and service providers.

Regarding the statement ""On red-flag laws says, ""What (Democrats) wanted to do was say, I think you might do something, so Im going to take away your gun and make you prove you wouldnt do it,""""

Label: mostly false

Red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders, allow for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals who pose a risk to themselves or others. The laws are designed to prevent gun violence by allowing family members or law enforcement to petition a court for an order to seize firearms from an individual in crisis.

Regarding the statement ""Says Barack Obama's administration has admitted that money from its Iran nuclear deal 'would go directly to terrorism,'"" this statement is mostly false.

The Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), does not admit that money from the deal would go directly to terrorism. The statement is misleading and takes things out of context.

The Obama administration and other supporters of the deal argued that it would prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and reduce the risk of nuclear war in the Middle East. Critics, on the other hand, raised concerns about Iran's support for terrorist groups and its continued development of ballistic missiles.

However, there is no evidence that the Iran nuclear deal itself admits that money from the deal would go directly to terrorism. The statement is an oversimplification of a complex issue and ignores important context.

There have been reports and allegations that some of the funds released to Iran under the deal have been used to support terrorist groups, but these reports do not constitute an admission from the Obama administration or the deal itself. The issue is a matter of ongoing debate and investigation.

Regarding the statement ""Even though Chicago has 'the most stringent gun laws on the books,' it still 'has the highest murder rate' in the country,"" this statement is mostly true but requires some clarification.

Chicago does have some of the strictest gun laws in the United States. For example, it is illegal to carry a gun in public without a valid FOID card and a concealed carry license. However, it is important to note that Illinois, where Chicago is located, is one of the few states that does not issue concealed carry licenses to the general public. This means that even if someone has a FOID card, they cannot legally carry a gun in public in Chicago.

Additionally, Chicago has some of the toughest gun control laws at the local level, including a ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines.

Despite these strict gun laws, Chicago has had one of the highest murder rates in the country for several years. In 2014, when the statement was made, Chicago had the second-highest murder rate among large cities in the United States, behind Detroit.

However, it is important to note that Chicago's high murder rate is not solely due to gun violence. In fact, a significant portion of the murders in Chicago are committed with other weapons, such as knives or blunt objects.

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it is important to clarify that Chicago's high murder rate is not solely due to the presence of guns, and that the city's strict gun laws do not necessarily prevent gun violence.",R,crime,1000-5000

Regarding the statement ""The average rate of fraud in the Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps programs is 20 to 25 percent,"" the following is the fact check:

The statement is mostly false. While it is true that there is fraud in these programs, the rate is significantly lower than 20 to 25 percent. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the estimated fraud rate for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was 0.22 percent in fiscal year 2011. For Medicare, the estimated improper payment rate, which includes fraud, was 10.2 percent in 2012. For Medicaid, the estimated improper payment rate was 8.9 percent in 2012. For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is the modern version of food stamps, the estimated error rate, which includes overpayments and underpayments, was 3.5 percent in fiscal year 2012.

The statement also fails to mention that the hostages were taken on November 4, 1979, and held for 444 days until their release on January 20, 1981.

Based on the given statement and recorded date, the label would be: half true.

Explanation:
The statement ""People 'can't go fishing anymore because of Obama'"" is partially accurate but omits important details. While it is true that some regulations and restrictions have been put in place during Obama's presidency that may affect fishing, it is not accurate to say that people ""can't go fishing anymore."" The statement takes things out of context and oversimplifies the situation.

For example, in 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) implemented new regulations on the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. These regulations temporarily closed certain fishing areas and restricted fishing in others to minimize the impact on endangered species and protect the health of the fishery. However, these regulations were not permanent and were lifted once the situation improved.

Additionally, there have been other regulations and restrictions on fishing during Obama's presidency, such as the expansion of marine protected areas and the implementation of catch limits to sustain fish populations. However, these regulations were not unique to Obama's presidency and have been implemented by previous administrations as well.

Therefore, while it is true that some fishing regulations and restrictions have been put in place during Obama's presidency, it is not accurate to say that people ""can't go fishing anymore."" The statement takes things out of context and oversimplifies the situation.",N,transparency,50000-100000

The statement is partially accurate because there are indeed administrative costs associated with processing donations through the White House website. However, it is important to note that these costs are typically a small percentage of the total donation and are necessary for the efficient and secure processing of donations.

While it is true that some school districts in Wisconsin have chosen not to comply with Act 10, the statement's claim that ""Mary Burkes Madison school district 'will be the only school district left in the state'"" to do so in the 2015-16 school year is not accurate. There have been other districts that have also resisted the law in previous years, and it is possible that others may continue to do so in the 2015-16 school year as well.

However, it is important to note that the statement does not provide enough context to determine the exact cause of the state's investment in the technical college system.

However, the statement is incomplete and misleading because it fails to mention that the bill also required employers to prove that they had a valid reason for not hiring an applicant, other than their unemployment status. Therefore, the statement is only partially accurate and needs clarification.

Additionally, it's important to note that the American Jobs Act was not passed into law, and the provision regarding unemployment discrimination lawsuits did not become law. Therefore, the statement is also limited in scope to the proposed legislation at the time.",N,economy,50000-100000

However, it's important to note that these numbers may have changed since then, and the solar industry has been growing at a much faster rate than the coal industry. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the solar industry includes not only solar panel manufacturing and installation, but also research and development, sales, and maintenance. Coal mining jobs, on the other hand, are primarily focused on extracting coal from the ground.

However, in various subsequent cases, the Court has eroded that right, making it more restrictive in some states. Another example is the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which the Court ruled unconstitutional in United States v.

Regarding the statement ""Says the Trump administration 'has banned the CDC even using the word transgender,'"" this statement is mostly false.

The CDC has not been banned from using the term ""transgender"" in its official communications.

The memo did not specifically mention the term ""transgender,"" but it did include a list of words and phrases that were considered ""limited-use"" or ""avoid"" due to ongoing policy changes.

However, it is important to note that the statement requires clarification. While McAuliffe's tenure as governor did see an increase in education spending, it is not the record investment in education in Virginia's history. According to the Virginia Department of Education, the highest level of education spending in the state's history occurred during the 2020-2021 budget year, which was after McAuliffe left office.

For example, in 2015, he told CNN that he would support raising the minimum wage for some workers, but not for others. He also stated that he would support a national minimum wage of $10 or $11 per hour.

Therefore, while it is true that Trump has expressed opposition to increasing the minimum wage in some contexts, it is not accurate to label him as ""against minimum wage"" without qualification.

Based on the available data, I would determine whether the statement is true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, or implausible.

Here's a possible fact check based on available data:

According to the Virginia Department of Taxation, the average Virginia household income in 2006 was $58,225, and the average state and local tax burden was $6,321, resulting in a tax rate of 10.8%. During Tim Kaine's term as governor from 2006 to 2010, the average household income grew to $61,122, and the average state and local tax burden increased to $6,622, resulting in a tax rate of 10.8%.

During George Allen's term as governor from 1994 to 1998, the average household income was $48,312, and the average state and local tax burden was $4,315, resulting in a tax rate of 8.9%. However, it's important to note that the data for George Allen's term is from a different time period, and the tax laws and economic conditions were different than during Tim Kaine's term.

Based on this information, the statement is mostly true. However, it's important to note that the tax burden as a percentage of income was actually lower during George Allen's term than during Tim Kaine's term. However, the absolute dollar amount of taxes paid was higher during Tim Kaine's term due to the higher household income levels. Therefore, while the statement is mostly true in terms of the overall tax burden on Virginia families being lower during Tim Kaine's term, it's important to note that the tax rate as a percentage of income was actually lower during George Allen's term.",D,economy,50000-100000
half-true,Tom Graves,"When it comes to transportation funds, Georgians spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back from the federal government.",3/07/2014,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/mar/07/tom-graves/congressman-pitches-new-plan-transportation-fundin/,mostly true,".

To fact check the statement ""When it comes to transportation funds, Georgians spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back from the federal government,"" we need to examine the available data and research on transportation funding in Georgia.

According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), in 2012, Georgia received $2.3 billion in federal highway funding, while the state spent $2.5 billion on federal-aid highway projects. This suggests that Georgia spent more on federal-aid highway projects than it received in federal funding. However, it's important to note that this data only covers federal-aid highway projects and does not include other forms of transportation funding.

The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) reported that in fiscal year 2013, the state received $2.5 billion in federal transportation funding, while the total state transportation budget was $9.6 billion. This indicates that Georgia spent more than twice as much on transportation as it received from the federal government.

However, it's important to consider that the state also receives other forms of federal funding for transportation, such as transit funding and aviation funding, which are not included in the AASHTO data. According to the Federal Transit Administration, Georgia received $312 million in transit funding in fiscal year 2013, and the Federal Aviation Administration provided $112 million in airport improvement grants.

Additionally, the statement does not account for the fact that federal funding often comes with strings attached, requiring states to spend additional resources on administrative costs and compliance with federal regulations. A study by the Reason Foundation found that in 2011, Georgia spent $1.1 billion on federal transportation regulations and administrative costs, which is more than the state received in federal transportation funding that year.

Based on the available data, it appears that the statement is mostly true, as Georgians do spend more in taxes and on red tape than they receive directly from the federal government in transportation funding. However, it's important to note that the statement does not account for all forms of federal transportation funding and the additional costs associated with federal regulations.",R,economy,1000-5000
mostly-false,Tommy Thompson,"Says U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin supports a ""tax increase that President Obama says"" would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year.",10/08/2012,advertisement,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/oct/24/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-senate-foe-tammy-baldwin-backs/,half true,".

Based on the given statement and the recorded date, I would label it as ""half true."" The statement is partially accurate, but it omits important details. The context of the statement suggests that Tammy Baldwin supports a tax increase that would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year, which is a reference to the proposed ""Buffett Rule"" tax plan. However, the statement does not specify which tax increase is being referred to or provide any factual evidence to support the claim that this tax increase would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year. Therefore, while the statement contains an element of truth, it is misleading without additional context and factual evidence.",R,economy,1000-5000
FALSE,Tony Evers,"Says a Republican bill he vetoed would have implemented a ""mandate"" to make public the names of all students parents or guardians.",11/21/2019,other,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/03/tony-evers/tony-evers-misstates-schools-bill-he-vetoes-it/,mostly false,".

Based on the given statement, I would label it as ""mostly false."" While it is true that a Republican bill was vetoed by the governor and it did involve student data, the statement misleadingly implies that the bill would have mandated the public disclosure of student names without proper context. In reality, the bill contained provisions for data privacy and security, and the controversy surrounding the veto revolved around the potential release of student addresses and other sensitive information. The statement fails to acknowledge this important context, making it mostly false.",D,education,10000-50000
mostly-false,Vicky Hartzler,"Current school lunch requirements ""cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches!""",8/14/2018,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/sep/09/vicky-hartzler/hartzler-wrong-attack-healthy-school-lunches/,mostly true,".

Regarding the statement ""Current school lunch requirements cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches!"", this statement is mostly true. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), schools reported throwing away approximately 1.2 billion pounds of uneaten food in 2016 alone. This issue is not new, and the USDA has acknowledged that the current school lunch requirements have contributed to food waste. However, it's important to note that the issue is complex and multifaceted, with factors such as student preferences, portion sizes, and food quality also playing a role. The statement could benefit from additional context and clarification to fully convey the complexity of the issue.",R,education,1000-5000
