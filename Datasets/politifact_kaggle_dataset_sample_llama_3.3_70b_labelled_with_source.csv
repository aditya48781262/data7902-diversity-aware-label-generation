On May 1, 2016, Bernie Sanders was still in the running for the Democratic presidential nomination. At that point, he was behind Hillary Clinton in the delegate count. While it was mathematically possible for Sanders to win enough pledged delegates to catch up, the chances were slim and would have required significant wins in the remaining primaries. Sanders' statement acknowledges the difficulty but does not convey the full extent of the challenge he faced. Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but lacks important context regarding the improbability of his situation.

The statement is partially accurate in that Bernie Sanders did propose raising the minimum wage to $15, and Hillary Clinton did propose raising it to $12. However, the statement omits important details, such as the fact that Clinton later revised her proposal to $15 in certain areas with a higher cost of living, and that the context of the statement is a political campaign where the goal is to differentiate oneself from the opponent. 

Additionally, the statement takes things out of context, as it implies that Clinton's proposal was static and never changed, when in fact, she did revise her proposal.

While it is difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage, it is true that a significant portion of the budget goes towards other areas such as personnel costs, equipment, and maintenance, rather than directly fighting international terrorism. However, the statement lacks specificity and clarity on what constitutes ""fighting international terrorism"" and how the budget is allocated towards this goal. Additionally, the budget for counterterrorism efforts is often dispersed across different departments and agencies, making it challenging to determine a precise percentage.

Although the exact percentages might vary slightly depending on the source and methodology used, the general trend that the top fraction of a percent holds a disproportionate amount of wealth compared to the vast majority of the population is supported by various economic analyses and data available up to 2016.

The statement that ""Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool"" under the new health care law, as made by Crossroads GPS on 5/16/2012, refers to potential outcomes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The ACA, signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010, aimed to increase health insurance quality and affordability, lower the uninsured rate by expanding insurance coverage, and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government.

The statement could be seen as partially accurate because the ACA did introduce changes to health insurance markets and employer-sponsored coverage, which could lead to some individuals losing their existing coverage.

The statement that Hillary Clinton promised 200,000 jobs for upstate New York and that not only did those jobs not materialize but the area lost jobs, requires scrutiny. 

In her 2000 Senate campaign, Hillary Clinton did propose an economic development plan for upstate New York, which included the goal of creating 200,000 jobs. However, the context and specifics of this promise are important. The plan was designed to be implemented over several years and was contingent on various factors, including federal and state funding, as well as private sector investment. 

While it is true that the job creation goal was ambitious and not fully met during her tenure as Senator, the assertion that the area lost jobs overlooks the complexities of economic development and the impact of broader economic trends, including national and global economic conditions.

The statement """"Long gas lines forming in North Korea"""" made by Donald Trump on 9/17/2017 is not supported by any credible evidence or reports from that time. In fact, there were no notable reports of long gas lines in North Korea around that date. It's possible that Trump may have been referring to a different time or event, but without further context or evidence, the statement appears to be an exaggeration or fabrication. Additionally, North Korea's gas supply and distribution system is not typically transparent, making it difficult to verify such claims. Therefore, the statement is labeled as false.

- These allegations included claims of groping and forcing himself on women, which were made public through various media outlets.
- While some of the allegations may have been disputed or denied by Trump or his representatives, it is inaccurate to claim that they were ""largely debunked"" as of the date of the statement.
- The term ""largely debunked"" implies a significant portion of the allegations were proven false, which was not the case at the time.

The call was at the center of an impeachment inquiry against Trump, with allegations that he pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a political rival. Adam Schiff, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not ""make up"" the call, as Trump claims. Instead, Schiff paraphrased the call in a hearing, which Trump and his allies criticized for not being a verbatim recitation of the conversation. Trump's decision to release the transcript was seen by many as an attempt to counter the narrative presented by Schiff and Democrats, but it did not exonerate him from the allegations of misconduct.

While the process for refugees, including those from Syria, involves a thorough vetting process and can be lengthy, there was no blanket ban on Christians from Syria.

Biden did express reluctance to discuss his stance on court-packing during the 2020 presidential campaign, which could be interpreted as his staff or himself avoiding direct answers on the topic.

However, the context and her subsequent statements and actions suggest that her support for the act was more about border security and not necessarily about building a wall across the entire border, as Trump's statement might imply. Clinton has also expressed opposition to Trump's proposal for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border during her 2016 presidential campaign.

The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was a multifaceted event with roots in subprime lending, deregulation, and global economic conditions, among other factors. While Greene's actions, like those of many other financial actors, contributed to the instability, attributing the entire economic downturn to him is misleading and lacks context.

Without more information about the district's boundaries, the areas he has represented, and the context of the election, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the statement fully.

The statement is mostly true because, at the time of the statement (July 7, 2011), the United States had retired its Space Shuttle program, which was the primary means of transporting astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). As a result, the U.S. had to rely on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport its astronauts to the ISS. The cost of a seat on a Soyuz spacecraft was around $50 million per astronaut, although this figure could vary. 

However, it's worth noting that the statement could be misleading, as it implies that the U.S. was being forced to pay the Russians $50 million per astronaut as a result of some new development or agreement. In reality, the U.S. had been paying Russia for seats on Soyuz spacecraft since 2006, as part of a long-standing agreement between the two countries.

Charlie Crist, the then-Republican Governor of Florida, did indeed campaign with President Barack Obama in support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as the stimulus package, on February 10, 2009. This event was notable because it was one of the few instances where a prominent Republican openly supported a major policy initiative of the Obama administration. However, it's worth noting that while Crist was a prominent Republican at the time, the statement could be seen as slightly exaggerated in implying he was the ""only"" prominent Republican to do so, as there might have been other less visible or less prominent Republicans who also supported the stimulus.

The reasoning is as follows: 
The statement was made on 9/20/2013, and at that time, there were polls indicating that a significant portion of the American public opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). However, the same polls also showed that the public was divided on the issue of defunding the healthcare law, especially if it meant shutting down the government. For instance, a CNN/ORC International poll conducted around that time found that while 57% of respondents opposed Obamacare, 60% opposed defunding it if it meant shutting down the government. This indicates that while there was support for defunding Obamacare, the support was conditional and did not necessarily extend to shutting down the government.

The statement refers to a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns, which was a topic of discussion around that time. However, the accuracy of the number ""over 700,000 Americans"" being on some watch list is not verified, and it is also not clear which specific watch list or lists are being referred to. The context of the statement suggests it was made during a debate about gun control and terrorism, but without more specific information about the source of the number and the criteria for being on such a list, the statement cannot be fully confirmed.

The reason for this label is that the statement was made by Marco Rubio on June 28, 2017, in the context of the proposed Senate healthcare bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA). At the time, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had estimated that the BCRA would lead to significant reductions in Medicaid funding, which would likely result in reduced benefits or coverage for many Medicaid recipients. Therefore, Rubio's statement that ""there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid"" was not supported by the available evidence and was misleading.

The reasoning is as follows: 
The statement seems to be a personal anecdote from Mike Huckabee's college days. Without further context or evidence, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this specific claim. However, it is known that in some parts of the United States, particularly in the Southern region, squirrel is considered a game meat and is consumed. The method of preparation can vary, including frying. Therefore, while the statement could be true, without more details or confirmation, it's hard to classify it as entirely true. Additionally, the use of a popcorn popper for frying squirrel, although unconventional, does not necessarily make the statement false, as people have been known to use unconventional methods for cooking. Thus, the statement is partially believable but lacks sufficient context or evidence to be considered fully true.

The reason for this label is that Mitt Romney's father, George Romney, did not march with Martin Luther King. While George Romney was a supporter of civil rights and did participate in civil rights events, there is no evidence to suggest that he marched with Martin Luther King. Mitt Romney has since acknowledged that he did not see his father march with Martin Luther King, and has clarified that his statement was an error. 

This label is chosen because the statement is not accurate, with no factual support or misleading information. The statement is not true, and the speaker has acknowledged the error. 

Note: The date of the statement (12/6/2007) is relevant because it was during Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, and the statement was likely made to appeal to voters. The source of the statement (Mitt Romney) is also relevant because it is a direct quote from the speaker.

The statement that ""utility bills are higher"" under the Obama economy could be seen as true in the context of increased electricity prices.

The statement, however, omits important details about the law's benefits and the context in which the government's role in healthcare was expanded. It suggests a more direct and intrusive role than actually exists, as the primary interactions regarding healthcare decisions remain between patients and their healthcare providers.

The statement that ""Massachusetts schools 'are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states'"" was made by Mitt Romney on 10/3/2012. At the time of the statement, Massachusetts did indeed have a strong reputation for its education system, and various rankings and studies supported its high standing among the states. For instance, in the 2012 Quality Counts report by Education Week, Massachusetts was ranked first in the nation for education, considering factors like academic achievement, education policy, and outcomes. However, the ranking can vary depending on the specific criteria used, such as graduation rates, test scores, or funding.

The statement is false because President Obama did not tell people to skip coming to Las Vegas for conventions and meetings. In fact, President Obama has encouraged people to visit Las Vegas for conventions and meetings, as it is a major tourist destination and an important part of the local economy. 

Mitt Romney's statement appears to be a misrepresentation of President Obama's actual comments, which were likely taken out of context or distorted for political gain. This type of statement is an example of a false narrative that can be damaging to a person's or organization's reputation. 

It's worth noting that fact-checking organizations and reputable news sources have debunked similar claims made by Mitt Romney and other politicians, highlighting the importance of verifying information through credible sources before accepting it as true.

The reasoning is that Romney's statement of ""Twenty-five or 24 million people"" is close to the actual number of 23.8 million people who were unemployed or not in the labor force in January 2012, and his statement does not contain any significant factual inaccuracies. 

However, it needs clarification that the number includes both unemployed and not in the labor force, which might not be immediately clear from the statement.

The statement claims that the state workforce has been reduced by 12.4 percent since the beginning of the economic downturn in FY 2008.

Additionally, the statement does not provide information about the overall impact of the workforce reduction on the state's budget and services.

However, the statement lacks important context regarding the specific relief package or legislation it refers to, the exact income thresholds for eligibility, and the conditions under which these payments were made.

Pete Buttigieg's statement reflects the general sentiment of many Americans who support the idea of having a choice to join a single-payer system like Medicare, rather than completely eliminating private insurance. This is supported by various polls and surveys conducted around the time of the statement (2019), which showed that a significant portion of Americans favored a public option or Medicare-for-all, but also wanted to retain the choice to keep their private insurance if they preferred. 

However, it's worth noting that the statement might not fully capture the complexity of opinions on healthcare reform, as some individuals might support a more radical shift towards a single-payer system without the option to keep private insurance.

The reasoning is as follows: 
President Obama did visit El Paso on May 10, 2011, and he did make a statement about the border being safer. However, the context of his statement was that the border was safer in terms of the number of personnel and resources allocated to it, not necessarily in terms of the overall crime rate or violence. Additionally, Obama's statement was made in the context of a broader discussion about the need for comprehensive immigration reform, which is not mentioned in the statement. Therefore, while the statement is partially accurate, it omits important details and takes Obama's statement out of context.

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, signed into law by President George W. Bush, set new energy efficiency standards for light bulbs. The law effectively phased out the use of traditional incandescent bulbs and encouraged the use of more energy-efficient alternatives like compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This legislation indeed gave the federal government a role in determining the types of light bulbs that could be used in the United States, aligning with Perry's statement. However, it's worth noting that the law did not outright ban incandescent bulbs but rather set standards that traditional incandescent bulbs could not meet without significant redesign.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which aimed to increase healthcare accessibility, was signed into law on March 23, 2010, but its major provisions had not yet taken effect by the date of Perry's statement.

The reason for this label is that the statement claims the job numbers released by Scott Walker are ""the final job numbers"" for 2011. However, it is common for job numbers and other economic data to be revised over time as more complete information becomes available. Therefore, labeling these figures as ""final"" might be misleading, as they could be subject to future revisions. Without additional context or clarification on whether these numbers are indeed the last update or if there is a possibility of revision, the statement is only partially accurate.

The statement claims that ""more than 70,000"" job openings are listed on a state jobs website, but without access to the actual data or the specific website in question, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. Additionally, the statement lacks context, such as the date range for which these job openings are available, the types of jobs, or the source of the data. Therefore, while the statement may be partially accurate, it omits important details that would give a more complete understanding of the situation.

The statement made by Scott Walker on 9/3/2014 claims that the Mary Burkes Madison school district would be the only school district left in the state to ignore Act 10 in the 2015-16 school year. However, without specific details on the compliance status of other school districts with Act 10 at that time, it's difficult to assess the absolute accuracy of the claim. The statement could be seen as an exaggeration or lacking context, as it does not provide a comprehensive view of how other districts were handling Act 10.

The statement is partially accurate because the technical college portion of property taxes in Wisconsin did decrease due to increased state funding. However, the statement omits important details, such as the fact that other portions of property taxes may have increased, and the overall impact on property taxes may not have been a decrease for all taxpayers. Additionally, the statement does not provide context about the specific circumstances of the speaker's property taxes, which may not be representative of the average taxpayer's experience.

The statement that ""There are state workers who are 'idle' at home during the coronavirus pandemic"" can be considered half true because, while it is possible that some state workers may not have been working at full capacity or were working remotely due to the pandemic, the term ""idle"" could be misleading. Many state workers, especially those in essential services like healthcare, public safety, and social services, continued to work diligently during the pandemic, often under challenging conditions. The statement by Scott Walker, a former governor known for his stance on public sector unions and worker benefits, might be perceived as taking the situation out of context or omitting the critical roles many state workers played during the crisis. Therefore, without additional context or clarification, the statement is only partially accurate.

The statement that Wisconsin's ""rainy day fund"" is ""165 times bigger than when we first took office"" as claimed by Scott Walker on 8/3/2015, requires verification against actual financial data from Wisconsin's state budget archives. 

Without access to the specific financial records or reports from the Wisconsin state government for the period in question, it's challenging to definitively classify the statement. However, considering typical political rhetoric and the context in which such statements are often made, it's plausible that the claim could be an exaggeration or lack context. 

For instance, the size of a ""rainy day fund"" can fluctuate significantly due to various economic factors, budget decisions, and the timing of the statement.

The statement made by Scott Walker on October 16, 2011, that ""The largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees"" requires scrutiny. While it's possible that some individuals with four-year degrees might be attending technical schools for additional training or to acquire specific skills, the general trend and data on technical school enrollment do not typically support the claim that the largest category of attendees are those with four-year degrees. Technical schools often attract individuals looking for vocational training, certification in a trade, or an associate's degree, which can include those with high school diplomas or equivalent, those looking for a career change, or those seeking to enhance their skills without necessarily having a four-year degree.

The statement is false because it misrepresents the content of President Barack Obama's jobs bill. The American Jobs Act of 2011, proposed by President Obama, did include provisions aimed at helping the unemployed, but it did not include a provision that would allow unemployed individuals to sue employers simply because they believed they were not hired due to their unemployment status. The bill focused on measures such as tax cuts for businesses that hire unemployed workers, infrastructure spending, and assistance for the long-term unemployed, among other provisions. The claim made by Sean Hannity about the ability to sue based on not being hired due to unemployment status is not supported by the actual content of the jobs bill.

The statement is based on a claim that President Obama said a tax increase would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year. However, there is no evidence that President Obama ever made such a statement. In fact, President Obama has consistently advocated for tax cuts for middle-class families, not increases. Therefore, the statement is misleading and contains a critical inaccuracy. 

Additionally, the statement implies that Tammy Baldwin supports a tax increase that would harm middle-class families, but it does not provide any evidence or context to support this claim. Without more information, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of this assertion. 

Overall, while the statement may contain some element of truth, it is largely misleading and inaccurate, making it mostly false.
