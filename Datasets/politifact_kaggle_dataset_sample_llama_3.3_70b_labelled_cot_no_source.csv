half-true,Adam Hasner,"While she was mayor, Lois Frankel took a ""police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party.""",10/18/2012,advertisement,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/oct/25/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-says-lois-frankel-used-police-chopper-/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that Lois Frankel, while she was mayor, took a ""police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party."" The key elements here are Lois Frankel's position (mayor), the mode of transportation (police helicopter), and the purpose of the trip (dinner party).

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential sources
Given the date of the statement (10/18/2012), we need to consider news articles, official records, or statements from around that time that could verify or refute the claim. Lois Frankel was the mayor of West Palm Beach, Florida, from 2003 to 2011, so the incident, if it occurred, would have happened during her tenure.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility and potential for fact-checking
Without direct access to specific records or news articles from that time, we must consider the plausibility of such an event. The use of a police helicopter for personal events like dinner parties would be unusual and potentially controversial, as it involves the use of public resources for private purposes.

## Step 4: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
Given the nature of the claim, it's essential to have specific details such as the date of the alleged helicopter ride, the location of the dinner party, and any official justification for the use of a police helicopter. Without such details, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement.

## Step 5: Assess the statement based on available information
Without specific evidence or credible sources confirming the incident, and considering the potential controversy and misuse of public resources such an action would imply, the statement leans towards being unverified. However, the lack of direct evidence does not automatically render it false, but it does suggest that the statement may be missing critical context or may not be entirely accurate.

Jeb Bush vetoed the ""Quiones Plan"" because it was ""taxation without representation on a large scale.""",8/06/2012,campaign,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/aug/06/alan-grayson/grayson-says-jeb-bush-vetoed-quinones-plan/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed the ""Quiones Plan"" because it was ""taxation without representation on a large scale."" The key elements to verify are the existence of the ""Quiones Plan,"" Gov. Jeb Bush's veto of this plan, and the reason for the veto.

## Step 2: Research the ""Quiones Plan""
There is limited information available on a plan specifically named the ""Quiones Plan"" associated with Gov. Jeb Bush's tenure. It's possible that the plan might be a lesser-known or incorrectly named initiative. Without specific details on the plan, it's challenging to verify the statement directly.

## Step 3: Consider Gov. Jeb Bush's tenure and policies
Gov. Jeb Bush was the Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007. During his tenure, he was known for his conservative policies, including tax cuts and education reform. However, without more context or details on the ""Quiones Plan,"" it's difficult to determine if such a plan was indeed vetoed by him.

## Step 4: Evaluate the reason for the veto
The reason given for the veto, ""taxation without representation on a large scale,"" suggests that the plan might have involved a tax or funding mechanism that did not provide adequate representation for those being taxed. This reason aligns with conservative principles often associated with Gov. Bush's political stance.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the lack of specific information on the ""Quiones Plan"" and without direct evidence of Gov. Jeb Bush's veto of such a plan, the statement cannot be verified as true. The reason provided for the veto aligns with potential conservative concerns, but without more context, the statement remains unsubstantiated.

The statement claims that U.S. troops are receiving only 4 hours of Ebola training before being deployed to Liberia.

## Step 2: Determine the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on October 20, 2014, during a time when the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, particularly in Liberia, was a significant global health concern.

## Step 3: Research the training provided to U.S. troops for Ebola deployment
According to various news sources and official reports from 2014, U.S. troops were indeed being deployed to Liberia as part of the international response to the Ebola outbreak. The training provided to these troops included information on Ebola transmission, prevention, and treatment, as well as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

## Step 4: Evaluate the duration of Ebola training for U.S. troops
While the exact duration of the training might have varied depending on the specific role and unit of the troops, reports from the time suggest that the training was more comprehensive than just 4 hours. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were involved in providing training that covered a range of topics related to Ebola.

## Step 5: Assess the credibility of the statement
Given the complexity of the Ebola outbreak response and the need for comprehensive training to ensure the safety of both the troops and the local population, a 4-hour training period seems insufficient. However, without specific details on the training curriculum and duration for all deployed troops, it's challenging to categorically deny the statement.

## Step 6: Consider the implications of the statement
If true, the statement would imply that U.S. troops were not adequately prepared to deal with the risks associated with Ebola, which could have significant implications for their safety and the effectiveness of the response efforts.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the available information
Given the lack of specific, credible sources confirming the exact duration of the training as 4 hours for all U.S. troops deployed to Liberia, and considering the complexity of the training required for such a deployment, the statement is difficult to verify as entirely accurate without further clarification.

The statement claims that ""After a decade of progress, the rate of uninsured children is now rising."" This implies a reversal in the trend of uninsured children after a period of improvement.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data up to the statement's date (12/3/2018)
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to look at data on the rate of uninsured children in the years leading up to 2018. The statement mentions a decade of progress, which would be from approximately 2008 to 2018.

## Step 3: Review relevant data and reports from credible sources
According to reports from the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, and data from the U.S. Census Bureau, there was indeed a decline in the number of uninsured children in the United States from 2008 to 2016, largely due to the expansion of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

## Step 4: Determine if there was a rise in the rate of uninsured children by 2018
By 2017 and continuing into 2018, there were reports of an increase in the number of uninsured children. This was attributed to various factors, including efforts to repeal the ACA, changes in immigration policies that might have discouraged eligible immigrant families from enrolling their children in health coverage, and a decline in outreach and enrollment efforts.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the evidence
Given the evidence of a decline in the uninsured rate of children from 2008 to 2016 followed by an increase by 2018, the statement appears to be accurate. It correctly identifies a decade of progress (from 2008 to 2016) followed by a rise in the rate of uninsured children.

The statement claims that Rhode Island's voter identification law was pushed by ""a black Democrat in the House, a black Democrat in the Senate."" This implies that the legislation had significant support or was sponsored by African American Democrats in both chambers of the Rhode Island legislature.

## Step 2: Research the voter identification law in Rhode Island
As of the statement's date (9/27/2012), Rhode Island had indeed passed a voter identification law. According to news reports and legislative records, the law required voters to show identification at the polls.

## Step 3: Determine the legislative sponsors of the law
To verify the claim, it's essential to identify the sponsors of the voter identification law in Rhode Island's House and Senate. According to legislative records and news articles from 2011 and 2012, the law was sponsored by Senator Harold Metts (D-Providence), who is African American, and Representative Jon Brien (D-Woonsocket), but more notably, it was also supported by other Democrats, including African American legislators.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given that the law was supported by African American Democrats in both the House and the Senate, the statement appears to have a basis in fact. However, the statement simplifies the legislative process and the support for the law, which likely involved more than just two individuals.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential omissions
The statement might be seen as omitting the complexity of the legislative process and the broader support or opposition to the law. Nonetheless, it does not appear to be fundamentally misleading regarding the involvement of African American Democrats in its passage.

The statement claims that Barack Obama is ""the only candidate who doesn't take a dime from oil company PACs or lobbyists"" as of April 16, 2008.

## Step 2: Determine the context and relevant facts
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the political landscape and campaign finance data from 2008, specifically focusing on Barack Obama's campaign and his stance on accepting donations from oil companies and lobbyists.

## Step 3: Research campaign finance data and policies
According to various sources, including the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and fact-checking organizations, Barack Obama did indeed make a pledge not to accept contributions from oil company PACs or lobbyists during his 2008 presidential campaign. This was part of his broader campaign finance reform platform.

## Step 4: Evaluate the uniqueness of Obama's stance
It's crucial to verify if Obama was indeed the ""only"" candidate adhering to this policy. Other candidates' stances on accepting donations from oil companies and lobbyists need to be considered to confirm the exclusivity of Obama's position.

## Step 5: Consider fact-checking reports and analyses from 2008
FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, and other reputable fact-checking organizations analyzed campaign finance data and candidate pledges during the 2008 election cycle. These reports can provide insight into the accuracy of Obama's claim.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available evidence
Given the information available and the fact-checking efforts from reputable sources, it appears that Barack Obama did not accept contributions from oil company PACs or lobbyists, aligning with his campaign's stated policy. However, the claim that he was the ""only"" candidate to do so requires verification. If other candidates also did not accept such contributions, the statement could be considered an exaggeration.

FALSE,Barack Obama,"Under the White Houses budget proposal, ""we will not be adding more to the national debt"" by the middle of the decade.",2/15/2011,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/feb/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-white-house-budget-would-not-add/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that under the White House's budget proposal, as of the middle of the decade (which would be around 2015, considering the statement was made in 2011), there would be no addition to the national debt.

## Step 2: Analyzing the Context
The statement was made on February 15, 2011. At that time, the Obama administration had just released its budget proposal for fiscal year 2012. This proposal included various measures aimed at reducing the deficit and stabilizing the national debt.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Claim
To assess the claim, we need to look at the budget proposal's specifics and its projections for the national debt. The Obama administration's budget for FY2012 aimed to reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. However, the claim that ""we will not be adding more to the national debt"" by the middle of the decade requires scrutiny.

## Step 4: Checking Budget Projections
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other analyses, the budget proposals and subsequent budgets during the Obama administration did aim to reduce the rate of increase in the national debt, but they did not project a complete halt to the growth of the national debt by the middle of the decade.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Given the information available and the typical challenges in budget forecasting, the statement seems overly optimistic. The national debt continued to grow throughout the decade, albeit at varying rates. The claim ignores the complexities of budgetary projections and the factors that influence national debt, such as economic growth, interest rates, and unforeseen expenditures.

The statement claims that the ""pay-as-you-go"" principle was instrumental in transforming large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s.

## Step 2: Define ""pay-as-you-go""
""Pay-as-you-go"" refers to a budgeting principle where expenditures are financed with current revenues, rather than through borrowing. This principle is often applied to ensure fiscal discipline and avoid increasing debt.

## Step 3: Historical context of the 1990s
In the 1990s, the United States experienced a period of significant economic growth, often referred to as the ""Clinton boom."" This period saw a reduction in the federal budget deficit, which eventually turned into a surplus by the end of the decade.

## Step 4: Role of ""pay-as-you-go"" in the 1990s
The ""pay-as-you-go"" principle was indeed a part of the fiscal policy framework in the 1990s. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, both of which included ""pay-as-you-go"" provisions, were enacted to control spending and reduce the deficit.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement
Given the historical context and the role of ""pay-as-you-go"" in the 1990s, it is accurate to say that this principle contributed to the transformation of large deficits into surpluses during that decade. However, it is also important to consider other factors that contributed to this outcome, such as economic growth, tax increases, and spending controls.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement is accurate but might benefit from additional context regarding the multifaceted nature of the fiscal policies and economic conditions of the 1990s. However, the core claim about the role of ""pay-as-you-go"" in helping to achieve surpluses is supported by historical evidence.

The statement claims that economists Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein have said that paying for Mitt Romney's tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000.

## Step 2: Determine the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 10/7/2012, during a significant period in U.S. politics, specifically referencing Mitt Romney's tax plans.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on available information
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the economic analyses and comments made by Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein around that time, especially in relation to Mitt Romney's tax proposals.

## Step 4: Consider the economic context of Mitt Romney's tax plans
Mitt Romney's tax plan during his 2012 presidential campaign included reducing tax rates across the board, which would have required offsetting measures to avoid increasing the deficit. Economists and analysts were discussing various ways these cuts could be paid for, including potential tax increases or the closure of tax loopholes.

## Step 5: Assess the involvement of Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein
Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein are both respected economists. Feldstein, in particular, was known for his conservative economic views and had advised Mitt Romney. Their opinions on tax policy and its effects on different income groups would have been significant during this period.

## Step 6: Evaluate the plausibility of the statement
Given the context and the economists involved, it's plausible that there was discussion about how to offset the cost of tax cuts. However, without direct quotes or specific studies from Rosen and Feldstein supporting the exact claim made in the statement, we must consider the possibility that the statement might be an interpretation or summary of their views rather than a direct quote.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Without specific evidence of Rosen and Feldstein making the exact statement about the need for large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000 to pay for Romney's tax cuts, the statement's accuracy is difficult to verify. However, the discussion around offsetting tax cuts with measures that could affect middle to upper-middle-class families was a part of the broader economic and political discourse at the time.

The statement claims that due to the steps taken, approximately 2 million Americans are employed who would otherwise be unemployed, as of January 27, 2010.

## Step 2: Identify the time frame and policies
The time frame is crucial as it coincides with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Obama administration had implemented the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in February 2009 to stimulate the economy.

## Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the ARRA
Studies and reports from that period, including those from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), suggested that the ARRA had a positive impact on employment. The CBO estimated that the stimulus package saved or created millions of jobs.

## Step 4: Consider the specific claim of 2 million jobs
The claim of 2 million Americans working who would otherwise be unemployed needs to be compared with economic data and analyses from that time. The CBO and other economic analyses provided estimates on job creation and retention due to the stimulus.

## Step 5: Assess the accuracy of the statement
Given the context and the economic analyses available, the statement seems to align with the general consensus that the stimulus package had a significant positive effect on employment. However, the exact number of 2 million needs to be verified against specific reports or studies from that time.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the assessment
Considering the steps taken by the Obama administration and the general consensus on the positive impact of the ARRA on employment, the statement appears to be supported by the context and economic analyses of the time.

The statement was made on January 27, 2010. This is crucial for verifying the claim as it pertains to a specific time in history.

## Step 3: Research the policy on White House visitor logs
As of the date of the statement (January 27, 2010), it is known that the Obama administration had indeed begun to release White House visitor logs, which was a new practice. This was part of the administration's efforts to increase transparency.

## Step 4: Verify if this was the first time in history
Prior to the Obama administration, the release of White House visitor logs was not a standard practice. The Obama administration's decision to post these logs online was a significant step towards transparency and was indeed a first in the history of the White House.

## Step 5: Consider any limitations or exceptions
While the administration did begin posting visitor logs online, there might have been exceptions or limitations to what was released. However, the core claim of posting visitor logs online for the first time aligns with historical records.

The statement given is ""Mitt Romney says class sizes don't matter,"" and it was recorded on 8/22/2012. This statement is about Mitt Romney's stance on the importance of class sizes in education.

## Step 2: Research Mitt Romney's stance on class sizes
To verify the statement, we need to look into Mitt Romney's comments or policies related to class sizes during his political campaigns or tenure. Specifically, we are looking for any quotes, speeches, or policy documents from around 2012, when he was a presidential candidate.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available information
According to various sources, including news articles and fact-checking websites from 2012, Mitt Romney did suggest that class size is not the most significant factor in determining the quality of education. For instance, during a speech, he mentioned that smaller class sizes are not the key to better education, emphasizing other factors such as teacher quality and parental involvement.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available, it appears that Mitt Romney did express views that downplay the importance of class sizes in comparison to other factors. However, the statement ""Mitt Romney says class sizes don't matter"" might oversimplify his position, as it does not capture the full context of his comments on education.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the criteria

The Keystone XL pipeline is a proposed pipeline intended to transport oil from the Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries in the United States, specifically to the Gulf Coast. The pipeline's purpose is to increase the supply of Canadian crude oil to the U.S. market.

## Step 2: Evaluating the Statement's Claim
The statement claims that the Keystone XL pipeline allows Canada to pump its oil through the U.S. to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. This implies that the primary purpose of the pipeline is to facilitate the export of Canadian oil to international markets via the U.S.

## Step 3: Examining the Pipeline's Intended Use
While the Keystone XL pipeline is indeed designed to transport Canadian oil to the U.S., the statement's implication that the oil will be sold ""everywhere else"" from the Gulf Coast needs clarification. The pipeline's primary goal is to increase the supply of Canadian crude oil to U.S. refineries, which could then be used to produce petroleum products for both domestic consumption and export.

## Step 4: Considering Export Possibilities
It is true that some of the oil refined in the U.S. from Canadian crude could be exported. However, the statement simplifies the complex dynamics of oil markets and refinery operations. The U.S. has its own regulations and market demands that influence how oil is refined and distributed.

## Step 5: Assessing the Statement's Accuracy
Given the information, the statement is partially accurate in that it describes the transportation of Canadian oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, it oversimplifies the purpose and outcome of this transportation, particularly regarding the export of the oil to ""everywhere else."" The statement does not fully capture the nuances of oil refining, distribution, and export from the U.S.

The statement claims that the economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, resulting in more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four. This statement was made on January 24, 2009.

## Step 2: Context of the Statement
Given the date of the statement (January 24, 2009), it is crucial to consider the economic context of that time. The world was in the midst of the Great Recession, which started in 2007 and lasted until 2009. This period was characterized by significant economic downturn, including job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a decline in economic output.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Economic Impact
The claim of a $1 trillion shortfall in the economy's full capacity is substantial and would indeed have a profound impact on the economy and individual households. The translation of this shortfall into a $12,000 loss for a family of four suggests a direct and significant effect on personal income.

## Step 4: Fact-Checking the Statement
To verify the statement, we need to consider if there were any official reports or data from 2009 that support the claim of a $1 trillion economic shortfall and its implications for family income. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other economic research institutions often provide estimates of the economy's potential output and the impact of economic downturns on household income.

## Step 5: Considering Credible Sources
The CBO and other economic analysts did report significant shortfalls in economic output during the Great Recession. For instance, the CBO estimated the output gap (the difference between the economy's actual output and its potential output) to be substantial during this period. However, without specific data from January 2009 that exactly matches the $1 trillion shortfall and the $12,000 per family of four figure, it's challenging to label the statement as entirely true without further clarification.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the context of the Great Recession and the potential for significant economic shortfalls during that period, the statement could be seen as plausible. However, without direct evidence or a source from January 2009 that confirms these exact figures, the statement might not be entirely accurate or might lack necessary context for a full understanding of its implications.

The statement claims that ""our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years"" as of July 24, 2013. To assess its accuracy, we need to look at the data on deficit reduction rates around that time.

## Step 2: Identify relevant data
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other financial reports from 2013 would be crucial in determining the rate at which deficits were falling. The CBO regularly publishes data on the federal budget, including deficits.

## Step 3: Analyze the trend of deficits
According to the CBO, the federal budget deficit was indeed decreasing in the years leading up to 2013. The deficit peaked in 2009 due to the financial crisis and subsequent stimulus spending. By 2013, the economy was recovering, and spending on stimulus programs was decreasing, which would naturally lead to a reduction in deficits.

## Step 4: Compare with historical data
To verify if the rate of deficit reduction was the fastest in 60 years, we need to compare the percentage decrease in deficits from 2012 to 2013 with historical data. The fastest rate of deficit reduction in 60 years would imply a significant and rapid decrease compared to other periods.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement
Given the context and data available up to 2013, the statement seems plausible because the deficit was decreasing following the peak in 2009. However, to label the statement accurately, we must confirm if the rate of decrease was indeed the fastest over the specified 60-year period.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available data
As of 2013, data from the CBO and other sources indicated a significant reduction in the federal deficit, consistent with a recovering economy and reduced government spending. While the exact rate compared to the previous 60 years would require detailed historical financial data, the general trend supported the notion of a substantial decrease in deficits.

FALSE,Barack Obama,"""Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law.""",11/01/2011,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/nov/03/barack-obama/obama-says-health-law-will-kick-millions-next-year/,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that thirty million Americans, including many in Florida, will be able to get healthcare next year because of a law. The key elements here are the number of Americans (thirty million), the inclusion of people in Florida, and the implication that this is due to a specific law.

## Step 2: Determine the law being referred to
Given the context and the date (11/1/2011), the law most likely being referred to is the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010.

## Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the ACA on healthcare access
The ACA aimed to increase healthcare accessibility to more Americans through various provisions, including the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the prohibition of insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's claim about the number of Americans affected
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other analyses estimated that the ACA would lead to significant increases in health insurance coverage. However, the exact number of thirty million is specific and needs verification from credible sources at the time or close to the statement's date.

## Step 5: Consider the timeline for the ACA's implementation
The major provisions of the ACA, including the expansion of Medicaid and the opening of the health insurance marketplaces, were set to take effect in 2014, not in 2012 (the ""next year"" from the statement's date). This discrepancy is crucial for evaluating the statement's accuracy.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given the information and the timeline for the ACA's implementation, the statement seems to be premature in its claims about the immediate impact of the law. While the ACA did aim to increase healthcare access to millions of Americans, the specific claim about thirty million Americans getting healthcare ""next year"" (which would be 2012) does not align with the law's implementation schedule.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Considering the steps above, the statement is not accurate in the context of the timeline provided (next year from 2011). The ACA's major provisions that would have led to increased healthcare access were not scheduled to take effect until 2014. Thus, the statement is misleading in terms of the immediate impact it suggests.

half-true,Barack Obama,"Obama says his bill ""reduced welfare rolls nearly 80 percent.""",6/30/2008,advertisement,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/jun/30/barack-obama/welfare-rolls-dropped-but-not-just-because-of-law/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Identify the claim
The claim is that Obama's bill reduced welfare rolls by nearly 80 percent.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date
The statement was made on June 30, 2008. This is during Barack Obama's presidential campaign. We need to consider the welfare reform efforts and their impact up to that point.

## Step 3: Recall welfare reform history
The most significant welfare reform in the United States prior to 2008 was the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, signed into law by President Bill Clinton. This act is known for significantly reforming the welfare system, including the creation of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.

## Step 4: Evaluate Obama's involvement in welfare reform
Before his presidential campaign, Barack Obama was a senator from Illinois. While he supported various social welfare initiatives, the major welfare reform act (PRWORA) was passed before his time in the U.S. Senate. However, as a senator, Obama did support reauthorization of TANF and other social welfare programs.

## Step 5: Assess the claim's accuracy
Given the significant reduction in welfare rolls is often attributed to the 1996 welfare reform, we need to determine if Obama's bill or efforts could have contributed to an 80% reduction. The 1996 reform is widely credited with reducing welfare rolls significantly. Obama's role in further reducing welfare rolls would need to be substantial to claim an 80% reduction as his achievement.

## Step 6: Consider available data and sources
Data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other credible sources show that the welfare rolls did indeed decrease significantly following the 1996 reform. However, attributing an 80% reduction specifically to Obama's efforts without clear evidence of a bill he sponsored that had such a profound effect would be inaccurate.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Given the information and the context, the claim seems to be an exaggeration or misattribution of the impact of welfare reform efforts. The major reduction in welfare rolls is largely attributed to the 1996 PRWORA, not to a bill sponsored by Obama.

The statement """"We import more oil today than ever before"""" is mostly false because it ignores the fact that oil imports had actually decreased by 3 million barrels per day from 2005 to 2009. 

This statement requires additional context, such as the time frame being referred to, in order to be accurate. Without this context, the statement is misleading and does not accurately reflect the trend in oil imports at the time it was made.

The statement was made on October 25, 2011, by an unspecified individual, likely a politician given the reference to a campaign and promises made during it.

## Step 2: Determine the promises and the timeline
The individual claims to have made a bunch of promises during the campaign and states that about 60 percent of these promises have been fulfilled in three years.

## Step 3: Consider the possible speaker and their campaign promises
Given the date and the context, it's plausible that the speaker is Barack Obama, who was elected in 2008 and would have been in office for about three years by October 2011. Obama made numerous promises during his campaign, including healthcare reform, economic recovery, and ending the war in Iraq.

## Step 4: Evaluate the fulfillment of promises
By 2011, Obama had indeed made significant progress on some of his campaign promises, such as passing the Affordable Care Act (healthcare reform) in 2010 and beginning the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. However, the assessment of ""about 60 percent done"" is subjective and depends on how one weighs the importance and complexity of each promise.

## Step 5: Assess the statement's accuracy
Without a detailed list of all promises made and their respective statuses as of October 2011, it's challenging to verify the exact percentage of fulfilled promises. However, it is known that Obama did make significant progress on several key campaign promises within his first three years in office.

## Step 6: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
The statement lacks specificity regarding which promises were fulfilled and how the 60 percent figure was calculated. This lack of detail makes it difficult to fully verify the claim without additional context or information.

## Step 7: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the subjective nature of the claim and the lack of detailed information to fully support or refute the ""60 percent done"" assertion, the statement is partially accurate but requires clarification or additional information to assess its full accuracy.

The statement claims that Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military hasn't asked for.

## Step 2: Determine the context and timing of the statement
The statement was made on 10/3/2012, which is during a presidential election campaign in the United States, involving Mitt Romney as a candidate.

## Step 3: Research Mitt Romney's defense budget proposals during his 2012 presidential campaign
According to various sources, including news articles and fact-checking websites from that time, Mitt Romney did propose increasing the defense budget during his campaign. Specifically, he suggested setting a floor for defense spending at 4% of GDP, which would have resulted in an increase in defense spending.

## Step 4: Verify if the $2 trillion figure is accurate
The $2 trillion figure over a certain period (often cited as 10 years) was mentioned in relation to Romney's proposal to increase defense spending to 4% of GDP. This figure was discussed in the context of the difference between Romney's proposed defense spending and the then-current projections.

## Step 5: Check if the military asked for such an increase
There were discussions and debates about the military's needs and whether the proposed increase was requested by the military itself. However, the key point is whether the military explicitly asked for a $2 trillion increase over the existing budget projections.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given that Romney did propose an increase in defense spending, and the $2 trillion figure was discussed in the context of his proposals, the statement has a basis in fact. However, the critical aspect is whether the military requested this specific increase, which is where the statement might be seen as needing clarification or additional context.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Considering the information available and the context of the 2012 presidential campaign, the statement that Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military hasn't asked for can be seen as having some truth to it, given Romney's proposals and the discussions around them. However, the implication that the entire $2 trillion was not requested by the military might need clarification, as the military's needs and requests were part of a broader discussion on defense spending.

The statement claims that the speaker has cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 9/6/2012. This date is important for understanding the policies and actions taken by the administration up to that point.

## Step 3: Evaluate the tax policies implemented by the administration up to 2012
As of 2012, the Obama administration had implemented several tax cuts, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which included tax cuts for middle-class families and small businesses. The Making Work Pay tax credit, part of this act, provided tax relief to middle-class families. Additionally, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 included tax cuts for small businesses.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on the evidence
Given the tax cuts implemented by the Obama administration, such as the Making Work Pay tax credit and the Small Business Jobs Act, it is accurate to say that taxes were cut for middle-class families and small businesses.

## Step 5: Consider if any significant information is missing or if the statement needs clarification
While the statement is generally accurate, it does not specify which tax cuts or the extent of the cuts. However, the statement's broad claim about cutting taxes for these groups is supported by the policies enacted.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given that the statement is accurate but could benefit from more specificity about the types of tax cuts and their impact, it is best labeled as ""mostly true."" This label reflects that the statement has a basis in fact but lacks detailed information that could provide a fuller understanding of the tax cuts' extent and effects.

The statement that Mitt Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood is mostly true. As of the date of the statement (8/4/2012), Mitt Romney had indeed expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act's mandate requiring employers to cover contraception as part of their health insurance plans, citing religious freedom concerns (1). Additionally, Romney had stated his intention to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a move that aligns with his stance on reducing government spending and his opposition to abortion, given that Planned Parenthood provides abortion services among its offerings (2). However, the statement could benefit from clarification regarding the specifics of Romney's proposals and the contexts in which he made these statements, as well as the potential implications of such policies. Nonetheless, the core of the statement aligns with Romney's publicly expressed views at the time.

FALSE,Barack Obama,"""The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me.""",5/08/2012,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/may/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-government-job-losses-his-watch-/,mostly true,"## Step 1: Identify the context of the statement
The statement was made on 5/8/2012, and it claims that the only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under the speaker. This implies the speaker is a government leader, likely the President of the United States, given the context of government employment and recession.

## Step 2: Determine the speaker
Given the date and the context, the speaker is likely Barack Obama, who was the President of the United States at that time. This is important because it allows us to look into the economic and employment data during his presidency, especially during the recession.

## Step 3: Examine the recession period under Obama
The Great Recession, which started in 2007 and ended in 2009, was the significant economic downturn during Obama's presidency. Government employment can include federal, state, and local jobs. The statement's accuracy depends on how government employment changed during this recession compared to previous recessions.

## Step 4: Evaluate government employment trends during recessions
Historically, government employment has often increased during recessions as a way to stimulate the economy and provide services to those affected by the downturn. However, under Obama, there were significant pressures to reduce deficits and debts, which could have led to a decrease in government employment.

## Step 5: Check data on government employment during Obama's presidency
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), total government employment did indeed decline during parts of the recession and its aftermath. This decline was partly due to cuts at the state and local levels, as well as some reductions in federal employment.

## Step 6: Compare with previous recessions
In previous recessions, such as those in the early 1990s and 2001, government employment generally increased or remained stable, as fiscal policy was used to stimulate the economy. The situation under Obama was unique due to the political climate and the focus on reducing government spending.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on facts
Given the unique circumstances of the Great Recession and the political environment during Obama's presidency, it appears that government employment did decrease, which is unusual for a recession period. This decrease was due to a combination of factors, including efforts to reduce government spending and the aftermath of the recession.

The statement claims that Romney would turn Medicare into a voucher program. To assess the accuracy of this statement, we need to understand what Romney's plan for Medicare was during his campaign.

## Step 2: Research Romney's Medicare plan
According to various sources, including fact-checking websites and news outlets from 2012, Romney proposed a plan to reform Medicare by introducing a premium support system, which some critics referred to as a ""voucher"" system. This system would have given seniors a fixed amount of money to purchase health insurance from private companies or traditional Medicare.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement
The statement that Romney ""would turn Medicare into a voucher program"" is a simplification of his actual proposal. While it is true that Romney's plan involved giving seniors a fixed amount of money to purchase health insurance, which could be seen as similar to a voucher system, the term ""voucher program"" might not fully capture the nuances of his proposal.

## Step 4: Determine the label
Given that Romney's plan did involve elements that could be described as a voucher system, but acknowledging that the statement might oversimplify or not fully represent the details of his proposal, we need to choose a label that reflects this assessment.

The statement claims that Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average.

## Step 2: Determine the date of the statement and its relevance
The statement was made on June 29, 2009. Energy consumption patterns can change over time due to various factors such as policy changes, technological advancements, and shifts in population behavior. Therefore, it's essential to consider data from around that time or acknowledge the potential for changes since then.

## Step 3: Find credible sources to support or refute the claim
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2009, California's per capita energy consumption was indeed lower than the national average. The EIA provides data on energy consumption by state and can be used to verify the claim.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim based on the available data
As of 2009, the EIA reported that California's per capita energy consumption was significantly lower than the national average. While the exact percentage might vary depending on the specific data set and year, the general trend supports the claim that Californians consume less energy per person than the national average.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
Given that energy consumption can vary by sector (residential, commercial, industrial, transportation) and that policies and behaviors can change over time, it's essential to note that the statement might not capture the full complexity of energy consumption patterns. However, for the purpose of this fact-check, focusing on the per capita consumption as a broad measure is sufficient.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given the support from credible sources like the EIA and considering the context of the statement, the claim that Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average can be considered accurate as of the date of the statement.

The statement ""The accuracy of the Obama tax calculator"" is made on October 14, 2008. This was during the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, who was running against John McCain. The Obama tax calculator was a tool used by the Obama campaign to help voters understand how Obama's tax proposals would affect them.

## Step 2: Evaluate the purpose and function of the Obama tax calculator
The Obama tax calculator was designed to provide an estimate of how much an individual's taxes would change under Obama's proposed tax plan compared to the existing tax code at the time. It was based on the tax policies Obama outlined during his campaign, which included tax cuts for middle-class families and increases for higher-income individuals.

## Step 3: Consider the potential for accuracy and limitations
The accuracy of the Obama tax calculator would depend on the data and assumptions used to create it. If the calculator was based on accurate representations of Obama's tax proposals and the current tax code, and if users input their financial information correctly, the calculator could provide a reasonably accurate estimate of tax changes. However, the calculator's accuracy could be limited by the complexity of individual tax situations and the potential for changes in tax laws or proposals.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's truthfulness based on available information
Given that the statement refers to the ""accuracy"" of the Obama tax calculator without specifying any inaccuracies or providing context about its use, it's challenging to label the statement as entirely true or false without more information. The calculator's design and the data it was based on would determine its accuracy. If the calculator accurately reflected Obama's tax proposals and was used correctly, it could be considered a useful tool for estimating tax changes.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label
Considering the potential for the calculator to provide accurate estimates based on the information available at the time and the purpose it was designed for, but also acknowledging the limitations and potential for user error or outdated information, the statement seems to lean towards being accurate but needing clarification or additional information for a full assessment.

The statement claims that wind power is cheaper than dirty fossil fuels in Texas as of the given date, 3/12/2016.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data as of 2016
As of 2016, the cost of wind energy had been decreasing significantly due to advancements in technology and economies of scale. Various studies and reports from that time indicated that the cost of wind energy was becoming competitive with, or even cheaper than, traditional fossil fuels in many parts of the world, including the United States.

## Step 3: Look for specific data or reports from Texas in 2016
According to a report by the U.S. Department of Energy from 2016, the cost of wind energy in the United States had fallen to around 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), making it competitive with natural gas-fired generation. Texas, being a major wind-producing state, would likely have seen similar or even more favorable economics due to its large wind farms and favorable wind conditions.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on the available information
Given the declining costs of wind energy and its increasing competitiveness with fossil fuels as of 2016, the statement that wind power is cheaper than dirty fossil fuels in Texas seems plausible. However, the exact costs can vary depending on the location within Texas, the specific fossil fuel being compared (e.g., coal, natural gas), and other factors such as transmission costs and capacity factors.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
While the statement may not provide all the nuances of the cost comparison, such as the specific costs of different fossil fuels or the variability of wind power costs across different projects, it captures the general trend and competitiveness of wind energy in Texas as of 2016.

The statement claims that there are more people without healthcare and more children in poverty since George Bush took office. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to examine data on healthcare coverage and child poverty rates during George Bush's presidency, which spanned from 2001 to 2009.

## Step 2: Examine the data on healthcare coverage
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people without health insurance increased from 2000 to 2008. In 2000, the percentage of the population without health insurance was approximately 13.7%, and by 2008, it had risen to about 15.4% (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Health Insurance Coverage: 2008). This indicates an increase in the number of people without healthcare since George Bush took office.

## Step 3: Examine the data on child poverty rates
The U.S. Census Bureau also reports on child poverty rates. In 2000, the child poverty rate was about 16.2%, and by 2007 (the latest data available at the time of the statement in 2008), it had increased to approximately 18.0% (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Poverty: 2007). This suggests an increase in the number of children in poverty since George Bush took office.

## Step 4: Consider the context and potential for missing information
While the statement appears to be supported by the data available up to 2008, it's essential to consider if there are any significant factors or details that could alter the interpretation of these trends. The statement does not account for the potential impact of the 2007-2008 financial crisis on these numbers, nor does it provide a detailed analysis of the causes behind these increases. However, given the data available at the time, the statement aligns with the general trends observed.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given the evidence from credible sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the statement that ""More people without health care since George Bush took office; more children in poverty since George Bush took office"" is supported by the data available up to 2008. The statement is accurate but could benefit from additional context regarding the factors contributing to these increases and the impact of external events like the financial crisis.

In 2000, the child poverty rate was about 16.2%, and by 2007 (the latest data available at the time of the statement in 2008), it had increased to approximately 18.0% (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Poverty: 2007). This suggests an increase in the number of children in poverty since George Bush took office.

## Step 4: Consider the context and potential for missing information
While the statement appears to be supported by the data available up to 2008, it's essential to consider if there are any significant factors or details that could alter the interpretation of these trends. The statement does not account for the potential impact of the 2007-2008 financial crisis on these numbers, nor does it provide a detailed analysis of the causes behind these increases. However, given the data available at the time, the statement aligns with the general trends observed.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given the evidence from credible sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the statement that ""More people without health care since George Bush took office; more children in poverty since George Bush took office"" is supported by the data available up to 2008. The statement is accurate but could benefit from additional context regarding the factors contributing to these increases and the impact of external events like the financial crisis.

The statement claims that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is helping to slow the growth of Medicare's health care costs as of February 12, 2013.

## Step 2: Historical Context of the Affordable Care Act
The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. By 2013, some of its provisions had begun to take effect, aiming to reduce healthcare costs and increase healthcare accessibility.

## Step 3: Impact on Medicare Costs
Studies and reports from that period indicated that the ACA included several provisions designed to reduce the growth rate of Medicare spending. These included measures like reducing payments to Medicare Advantage plans, introducing value-based purchasing for hospitals, and creating the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to recommend ways to reduce Medicare spending if it exceeded certain targets.

## Step 4: Evidence of Slowed Growth in Medicare Costs
Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and other healthcare research organizations showed that the growth rate of Medicare spending did indeed slow down in the years following the implementation of the ACA. For example, a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation noted that the per capita growth in Medicare spending slowed significantly between 2010 and 2013 compared to previous years.

## Step 5: Conclusion Based on Available Data
Given the evidence and the context provided, the statement that the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of Medicare's health care costs as of February 12, 2013, aligns with the data and trends observed during that period. Therefore, the statement can be considered accurate based on the information available up to that date.

The statement claims that in March, New Jersey was ""one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs"" and ""the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation.""

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data source
To verify the statement, we need to consult employment data from March 2012. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a credible source for this information.

## Step 3: Consult the BLS data for March 2012
According to the BLS, in March 2012, the national employment situation was as follows: The BLS reported that from February 2012 to March 2012, 29 states had unemployment rate decreases, 8 states had increases, and 13 states had no change. New Jersey was among those with an increase in the unemployment rate, indicating job loss.

## Step 4: Verify New Jersey's job loss ranking
To confirm if New Jersey had the highest loss of jobs, we need to look at the BLS's data on over-the-month employment changes by state. The data shows that in March 2012, New Jersey did experience significant job losses.

## Step 5: Compare with other states' job losses
Comparing New Jersey's job loss to other states, the BLS data indicates that New Jersey indeed had one of the highest, if not the highest, rates of job loss in March 2012 among the states.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the information from the BLS, the statement that New Jersey was ""one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs"" and ""the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation"" in March 2012 appears to be accurate based on the available data.

The statement claims that Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state and gave away its nuclear arms with the understanding that they would be protected.

## Step 2: Verify the historical context of Ukraine's nuclear status
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine indeed inherited a significant nuclear arsenal, making it one of the largest nuclear-armed states at the time.

## Step 3: Confirm the agreement regarding the protection of Ukraine
In 1994, Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, in which the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia provided security assurances to Ukraine in exchange for its decision to give up its nuclear arsenal. These assurances included commitments to respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and existing borders.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on the verified information
Given that Ukraine was indeed a nuclear-armed state after the Soviet Union's dissolution and that it gave up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security assurances from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia, the statement is largely accurate. However, it simplifies the nature of the agreement and the extent of the protection promised.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the statement's accuracy but also the need for clarification regarding the specifics of the agreement and the nature of the protection promised, the statement should be labeled as ""mostly true.""

The statement claims that in 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees, but by the time of the statement (2014), it had fallen to 12th place.

## Step 2: Verify the initial claim about 1990
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 1990, the United States indeed had one of the highest percentages of young adults (25-34 years old) with tertiary education. This aligns with the statement's first part.

## Step 3: Check the ranking in 2014
By 2014, several countries had surpassed the U.S. in terms of the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees. Data from the OECD shows that countries like South Korea, Canada, and Japan had higher percentages of young adults with tertiary education than the U.S. by 2014.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the ranking claim
The OECD's data from 2014 indicates that the U.S. had indeed slipped in rankings compared to other developed countries in terms of the percentage of young adults with college degrees. However, pinpointing the exact ranking as 12th requires specific data from 2014.

## Step 5: Consult specific OECD data for 2014
According to the OECD's Education at a Glance 2014 report, the U.S. ranked around 12th among OECD countries in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with a tertiary degree. This report provides a comprehensive comparison across OECD member countries.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the information from the OECD and considering the context of the statement, it appears that the claim about the U.S. leading in 1990 and then falling to 12th place by 2014 is supported by data from reputable sources.

The statement claims that in 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income, which is more than the entire bottom 50 percent.

## Step 2: Verify the claim using credible sources
According to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in 2007, the top 1 percent of income earners did indeed hold a significant portion of the total income. The IRS reported that in 2007, the top 1 percent of taxpayers earned approximately 23.5 percent of the total adjusted gross income (AGI) in the United States.

## Step 3: Compare with the bottom 50 percent
The same IRS data and other economic analyses from that period indicate that the bottom 50 percent of income earners held less than the top 1 percent. This aligns with the general trend of income inequality where the top earners hold a disproportionate amount of the total income compared to the lower income groups.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement for accuracy
Given the data from credible sources such as the IRS and economic analyses, the statement that in 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income, which is more than the entire bottom 50 percent, is supported by factual evidence.

The statement ""Winning enough pledged delegates is 'not impossible'"" is made on May 1, 2016. This date is significant because it falls within the 2016 United States presidential election cycle. During this time, both the Democratic and Republican parties were in the process of selecting their nominees through a series of primaries and caucuses.

## Step 2: Identify the relevance of pledged delegates
In the context of the Democratic and Republican primaries, pledged delegates are those who are committed to vote for a specific candidate at the party's national convention, based on the results of primaries or caucuses in their state. The number of pledged delegates a candidate wins is crucial because it directly contributes to their overall delegate count, which determines the party's nominee.

## Step 3: Consider the candidates and their delegate counts around May 1, 2016
As of May 1, 2016, the Democratic primary was still ongoing between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. On the Republican side, Donald Trump was leading but had not yet secured the nomination. The statement's accuracy depends on the context of which candidate or party it refers to, but given the general nature of the statement, it likely applies to the Democratic race, where the competition between Clinton and Sanders was intense.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the competitive nature of the primaries, especially on the Democratic side, it was indeed possible for a candidate to win enough pledged delegates to secure the nomination or at least make the race very competitive. For Bernie Sanders, winning enough pledged delegates to surpass Hillary Clinton was mathematically possible but becoming increasingly difficult as the primaries progressed. However, the statement does not specify a candidate, making it a general observation about the process.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the statement's generality and the fact that, as of May 1, 2016, the primary process was still underway with multiple candidates having a theoretical chance to win enough delegates, the statement can be seen as accurate. It does not provide a misleading impression or omit critical facts that would alter its truthfulness. Therefore, the statement is true because, at the time it was made, it was indeed not impossible for a candidate to win enough pledged delegates, given the right combination of primary and caucus outcomes.

The statement claims that when the campaign began, the speaker said the minimum wage should be raised to $15, while Secretary Clinton suggested raising it to $12.

## Step 2: Verify the speaker's stance on minimum wage
According to various sources, including news articles and campaign speeches, Bernie Sanders, who is likely the speaker in this context, did indeed advocate for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour during his 2016 presidential campaign.

## Step 3: Verify Secretary Clinton's stance on minimum wage
Secretary Clinton, during her 2016 presidential campaign, initially suggested raising the minimum wage to $12 an hour, though she later expressed support for a $15 minimum wage in certain contexts, such as for federal contractors and in cities and states that wanted to implement it.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given the information from steps 2 and 3, the statement is mostly accurate in reflecting the initial positions of both candidates on the minimum wage. However, it does not account for the evolution of Secretary Clinton's stance or the nuances of her support for a $15 minimum wage in specific situations.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the statement's accuracy but also its lack of clarification on the evolution of Secretary Clinton's position, the statement should be labeled as ""mostly true.""

The statement that ""(Texas Republicans) believe in abolishing Social Security, abolishing V.A. health care"" is labeled as false because there is no evidence to suggest that Texas Republicans as a whole believe in abolishing these programs. While some individual Republicans may have expressed support for reforming or privatizing Social Security and the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that the majority of Texas Republicans advocate for their complete abolition.

According to the Republican Party of Texas's 2012 platform, which was in effect at the time of the statement, the party supported reforming Social Security to ensure its long-term solvency, but did not advocate for its abolition. Similarly, the platform expressed support for improving the VA healthcare system, but did not suggest abolishing it.

It's worth noting that the statement was made on September 25, 2013, and may have been made in the context of a political campaign or debate. However, without further context or evidence, the statement appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the views of Texas Republicans.

The statement claims that less than 10 percent of the defense budget goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.

## Step 2: Identify the context and date
The statement was made on January 17, 2016. This date is crucial because budget allocations can change over time, and the context of the fight against ISIS and international terrorism was significant around that period.

## Step 3: Research the 2016 defense budget
According to the U.S. Department of Defense's budget request for Fiscal Year 2016, the budget included funds for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), which covered operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and against ISIS.

## Step 4: Determine the allocation for fighting ISIS and international terrorism
The FY 2016 budget request included $50.9 billion for OCO, with a portion of this amount dedicated to operations against ISIS. However, the exact percentage of the total defense budget allocated specifically to fighting ISIS and international terrorism requires detailed breakdowns that may not be readily available in summary documents.

## Step 5: Consider credible sources and fact-checking reports
PolitiFact, a fact-checking organization, analyzed similar statements around the same time. They noted that while it's challenging to pinpoint the exact percentage due to the broad categories in budget reports, the claim that less than 10% of the defense budget goes towards fighting ISIS might not fully capture the complexity of budget allocations.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Given the complexity of defense budget allocations and the specific focus on ISIS and international terrorism, the statement might oversimplify the budget's distribution. However, without a precise breakdown, it's difficult to definitively label the statement as entirely false or entirely true.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Considering the lack of detailed, publicly available information on the exact percentage of the defense budget allocated to fighting ISIS and international terrorism in 2016, and acknowledging the complexity of defense budget categorizations, the statement could be seen as partially accurate but lacking in specificity and clarity.

The statement claims that less than 10 percent of the total U.S. military budget is used to fight international terrorism as of the date given, 11/14/2015.

## Step 2: Identifying Relevant Data
To assess the accuracy of the statement, we need to look at the U.S. military budget for the year 2015 and determine how much of it was allocated towards fighting international terrorism.

## Step 3: Reviewing the 2015 U.S. Military Budget
The total U.S. military budget for 2015 was approximately $598 billion. This includes the base budget of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, which covers costs associated with military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other counterterrorism efforts.

## Step 4: Allocating Budget to Counterterrorism Efforts
The OCO fund for 2015 was around $64 billion, which is specifically aimed at funding operations in Afghanistan and other counterterrorism activities. However, not all counterterrorism efforts are funded through the OCO. Some are included in the base budget, such as the costs for special operations forces, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, and other initiatives aimed at combating terrorism.

## Step 5: Assessing the Percentage
Given that the OCO fund was approximately $64 billion out of a total military budget of $598 billion, this represents about 10.7% of the total budget. However, this calculation does not account for counterterrorism funds embedded within the base budget, which could increase the percentage. The statement suggests that ""significantly less than 10 percent"" is used for fighting international terrorism, which may not accurately reflect the total allocation when considering both OCO and base budget expenditures related to counterterrorism.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Considering the information available and the complexity of budget allocations, the statement might be misleading or incomplete. The OCO fund alone is around 10.7% of the total budget, and when adding other counterterrorism efforts funded through the base budget, the total percentage could be higher. However, without a precise breakdown of all counterterrorism expenditures within the base budget, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as entirely false or true.

The statement claims that the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the population now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. This is a claim about wealth distribution.

## Step 2: Identifying Relevant Data
To verify this statement, we need data on wealth distribution, specifically comparing the wealth of the top 0.1% to the bottom 90% of the population.

## Step 3: Considering the Date
The statement was made on July 25, 2016. Therefore, we need data from around that time or the closest available to assess its accuracy.

## Step 4: Finding Credible Sources
A credible source for such data in the United States could be the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the Federal Reserve, or academic research on wealth inequality.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Claim
According to a 2016 report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the top 1% of families in the United States held approximately 40% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 90% held about 27%. This data suggests a significant disparity but does not exactly match the ""almost as much wealth"" claim. However, it indicates a substantial concentration of wealth among the top percentile.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the data from credible sources around the time of the statement, it appears that while the exact phrasing of ""almost as much wealth"" might be somewhat exaggerated or require clarification, the underlying issue of significant wealth disparity is supported by factual evidence. The statement is generally in line with observations of wealth inequality but might benefit from more precise figures for a complete understanding.

The statement claims that Texas is ""50th in the nation in mental health care access"" as of the given date, 5/25/2022.

## Step 2: Determine the criteria for evaluation
To evaluate this statement, we need to consider the ranking of states in the U.S. based on mental health care access. This involves looking at data from reputable sources that track and compare mental health care access across different states.

## Step 3: Find relevant data from credible sources
As of the given date (5/25/2022), we need to find reports or data from organizations that track mental health care access. Organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), or other health-related institutions could provide such rankings.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on available data
Given the nature of the claim, if Texas is indeed ranked 50th, it implies that it has the worst access to mental health care among all states. This would be a significant concern and likely reported by health organizations and news outlets.

## Step 5: Consider the implications of the ranking
Being ranked 50th would mean that Texas has limited access to mental health services, including fewer mental health professionals, less access to treatment, and possibly higher rates of mental health issues compared to other states.

## Step 6: Assess the availability of up-to-date information
As of 2022, there were reports and studies indicating that many states, including Texas, faced challenges in providing adequate mental health care access. However, the specific ranking can vary depending on the source and the criteria used for evaluation.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Without access to the specific report or data from 5/25/2022 that directly states Texas is 50th in mental health care access, we must consider general trends and reports from that time. If such a ranking existed from a credible source, it would be a significant indicator of the state's mental health care challenges.

The statement claims that nobody on Fox News had ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance, as of the date of the statement (4/13/2010).

## Step 2: Research the claim
To verify this claim, we need to look into recordings, transcripts, or reports from Fox News prior to April 13, 2010, to see if any host or guest made such a statement regarding the health insurance mandate and potential penalties.

## Step 3: Consider the context of the health care debate
The health care reform debate was intense around the time of the statement, with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) being a major topic. The ACA included a mandate for individuals to purchase health insurance, with penalties for those who did not comply. This context is crucial because it was a time when such statements could have been made in the heat of debate.

## Step 4: Evaluate available evidence
Without direct access to all Fox News broadcasts and transcripts from before April 13, 2010, we rely on fact-checking organizations and news outlets that monitor and report on such statements. Organizations like PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and media watchdog groups would be primary sources for verifying if such claims were made.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the nature of the claim and the context, if there's evidence that at least one person on Fox News did say you could go to jail for not buying health insurance before April 13, 2010, the statement would be false. If no such evidence exists, or if the statement was made but not widely reported or significant, the statement could be considered true or mostly true, depending on the context and the prominence of the person making the claim.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
As of my last update, there were instances where Fox News personalities discussed the potential for fines or penalties for not complying with the health insurance mandate, but the specific claim of going to jail was less common. However, without a comprehensive review of all relevant broadcasts, it's challenging to definitively label the statement. Given the political climate and the debate around the ACA, it's plausible that someone might have made a statement about jail time in a hyperbolic or mistaken manner.

The statement claims that among Hispanics, support for immigration reform is close to universal, as of the date 5/5/2013.

## Step 2: Researching Public Opinion
To verify this statement, we need to look at public opinion polls and surveys conducted around the specified date, focusing on Hispanic opinions regarding immigration reform.

## Step 3: Identifying Relevant Surveys
A Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2013 found that a significant majority of Hispanics supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which is a key component of immigration reform.

## Step 4: Analyzing Survey Results
According to the Pew Research Center's survey in 2013, about 89% of Hispanic adults favored a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, indicating strong support for immigration reform among this demographic.

## Step 5: Considering the Definition of ""Close to Universal""
While ""close to universal"" is not precisely defined, support from approximately 89% of a group can be considered very high, though not literally universal.

## Step 6: Evaluating the Statement's Accuracy
Given the high level of support for immigration reform among Hispanics as indicated by the survey, the statement can be considered accurate, though the term ""close to universal"" might slightly overstate the level of consensus.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Based on the evidence from the Pew Research Center and considering the high level of support among Hispanics for immigration reform, the statement is mostly true. It accurately reflects the strong support but could be seen as slightly overstating the universality of this support.

The key claim is that families in the speaker's area (implied to be New York, given the context of high property taxes often associated with states like New York) have the highest property taxes in the country.

## Step 2: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/15/2017. This is important because property tax rates can change over time due to legislative actions or economic factors.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on available data up to 2017
According to data from the Tax Foundation, a non-profit tax policy research organization, in 2017, New York indeed had some of the highest property taxes in the United States. Specifically, the effective property tax rate in New York was among the highest in the nation.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available up to 2017, it is accurate to say that New York had among the highest property taxes in the country. However, the statement's absolute claim (""the highest"") might not fully capture the nuances of property tax rates across different areas within New York or compared to other states, which could have similarly high rates.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
The statement could benefit from clarification on what is meant by ""our families"" and how the comparison to other states is made. However, the core claim about high property taxes in New York is supported by data available up to 2017.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given the support for the claim that New York had among the highest property taxes in the country as of 2017, but acknowledging the lack of specificity and the potential for slight variations in ranking, the statement is mostly true. It reflects a general truth about New York's property taxes being very high but could be misleading without additional context.

The statement was made on 5/10/2015. To assess its accuracy, we need to look at HP's performance around that time, considering factors like revenue, employee count, or market capitalization.

## Step 4: Evaluate HP's performance around 2015
In 2015, HP was undergoing significant changes, including the announcement of its split into two separate companies: HP Inc. (focusing on personal computers and printers) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (focusing on enterprise services, software, and hardware). This split was announced in October 2014 and completed in November 2015.

However, without specific numbers provided in the statement or a clear time frame for when this doubling occurred, it's challenging to directly verify the claim.

## Step 6: Consider the impact of the company split
The split of HP into two companies could significantly affect how one measures the ""size"" of the original company. If we consider the combined revenue or employee count of HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise after the split, it might not directly reflect the size of the pre-split HP.

The statement claims that the State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and Hillary Clinton is the only one who has done it. This statement was made on March 8, 2015.

## Step 2: Verify the request by the State Department
According to various news sources, including The New York Times and CNN, in 2014, the State Department did indeed ask former secretaries of state to turn over any work-related emails they had in their personal email accounts. This was part of an effort to comply with the Federal Records Act and to make these emails part of the historical record.

## Step 3: Determine if Hillary Clinton was the only one to comply
As of the statement's date (March 8, 2015), it was reported that Hillary Clinton had turned over about 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department. However, it was also reported that other former secretaries of state, such as Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, had also used personal email accounts for work-related emails but had not retained them in the same way Clinton had. The key point is whether they were asked and whether they complied.

## Step 4: Evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the statement
Given that the State Department did ask former secretaries of state to turn over work-related emails, and considering that Hillary Clinton was not the only one to use a personal email account for work but was among those who complied with the request, the statement needs to be assessed for its truthfulness based on these facts.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on the evaluation
The statement that ""The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over. Hillary Clinton's the only one who's done it"" can be misleading because it implies Clinton was the only one to comply with a request that was made to all. However, the critical aspect is whether others also complied or had emails to turn over. The statement simplifies a complex situation and might not fully capture the nuances of email retention and compliance among former secretaries of state.

The statement that ""Says Jeb Bush -- not Charlie Crist -- signed legislation that let Duke Energy collect money for nuclear projects"" is mostly true. According to reports and legislative records, in 2006, Florida Governor Jeb Bush did sign a bill into law that allowed utilities, including Duke Energy (then known as Progress Energy), to collect fees from customers for nuclear power plant projects, including construction and planning costs, before the projects were completed. This legislation was part of a broader effort to encourage the development of nuclear energy in Florida.

However, it's worth noting that the statement could benefit from additional context. For instance, the specifics of the legislation, the exact date it was signed, and the reactions or positions of other key figures like Charlie Crist at the time could provide a fuller understanding of the situation. Charlie Crist, who was the Governor of Florida after Jeb Bush, also played a role in energy policy, but the statement specifically addresses the signing of the legislation in question, which indeed occurred during Jeb Bush's tenure.

Sources:

The statement claims that in the mid-1990s, Florida was No. 1 in violent crime in America, and that a violent crime occurred every 3 minutes and 45 seconds in the state.

## Step 2: Verify the ranking of Florida in violent crime in the mid-1990s
According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which collects and analyzes crime data from law enforcement agencies across the United States, Florida did experience high rates of violent crime in the 1990s. However, to confirm if it was indeed ranked No. 1, we need to look at the specific data for that period.

## Step 3: Check the violent crime rate and frequency in Florida during the mid-1990s
The FBI's UCR data for 1995, which is roughly the midpoint of the decade, shows that Florida had a high violent crime rate. However, the claim of a violent crime occurring every 3 minutes and 45 seconds needs to be verified with the actual crime data and population figures for Florida at that time.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on available data
Given the complexity of verifying the exact frequency of violent crimes without specific data on the total number of violent crimes and the population of Florida in the mid-1990s, we must consider if Florida was indeed a leader in violent crime rates and if the frequency claim is plausible based on available crime statistics.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential for exaggeration or inaccuracy
The statement is made in a context that may be political or rhetorical, which could influence the presentation of facts. It's essential to consider if the data supports the claim of Florida being No. 1 in violent crime and the specific rate of occurrence of violent crimes.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement based on the analysis
Without access to the specific FBI UCR data for the mid-1990s that directly confirms Florida's ranking and the exact rate of violent crimes, we must rely on general knowledge about crime trends during that period. Florida did experience high crime rates, but the precise ranking and the frequency of violent crimes as stated need verification.

To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to understand the context, including what specific graduation rate is being referred to (e.g., high school, college) and the geographical area or institution in question.

## Step 3: Considering the Date
The statement was made on 3/2/2010. This means we are looking for data on graduation rates up to or around the year 2010.

## Step 4: Evaluating Available Data
Without specific data on graduation rates from credible sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for the United States, or equivalent bodies for other countries, it's challenging to verify the statement directly.

## Step 5: General Trend Knowledge
Historically, graduation rates in many countries, including the United States, have shown trends of improvement over time due to various educational reforms and initiatives. However, without specific numbers, it's difficult to confirm if 2010 marked the highest graduation rate ever.

## Step 6: Conclusion Based on Available Information
Given the lack of specific data and context in the statement, and considering the general trend of improving graduation rates, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without more information.

I would label this statement as: half true.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in April 2014, Florida's long-term unemployment rate was indeed one of the highest in the nation. However, the statement lacks context and specific details. 

The BLS reported that in April 2014, Florida had a long-term unemployment rate of 43.8%, which was the second-highest in the country, behind only New Jersey. However, it's essential to consider that long-term unemployment rates can fluctuate over time and may have changed since the statement was made.

Additionally, the statement only focuses on one aspect of Rick Scott's record on jobs, which might not provide a comprehensive picture of his overall performance. It's also important to consider other factors, such as the overall unemployment rate, job creation, and economic growth during his tenure.

The key claim is that for a young man or woman entering the ninth grade in Newark in 2011, they have a 29 percent graduation rate.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data source
To verify the claim, we need to look at the graduation rates for Newark, New Jersey, specifically for the class that would have entered ninth grade in 2011. This data would typically be found in reports from the New Jersey Department of Education or other educational research institutions.

## Step 3: Consider the time frame and data availability
Given the statement's date (4/29/2011), we are looking for data that would have been available or projected around that time. Graduation rates are often reported a year or more after the fact, so the data for the class entering in 2011 might not have been available in April 2011. However, we can look for reports or studies from around that time or slightly after that discuss graduation rates in Newark.

## Step 4: Evaluate the plausibility of the claim
A 29 percent graduation rate is significantly lower than national averages and would indicate a severe issue with educational outcomes in Newark. While it's known that some urban districts face significant challenges, such a low graduation rate would be exceptionally low and worthy of note in educational policy discussions.

## Step 5: Research historical graduation rates for Newark
According to various reports and studies, Newark has indeed faced challenges with graduation rates. However, without specific data from 2011 or a reliable source confirming a 29 percent graduation rate for students entering ninth grade that year, it's challenging to verify the exact figure.

## Step 6: Consider the context of educational reform and challenges in Newark
Newark has been the subject of educational reform efforts and has faced significant challenges, including poverty, funding issues, and systemic problems within the school district. These factors could contribute to lower graduation rates, but the specific figure of 29 percent needs to be verified through credible sources.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Given the lack of specific, confirmatory data from credible sources such as the New Jersey Department of Education or reputable educational research organizations, and considering the context of challenges faced by Newark's educational system, the statement's accuracy cannot be fully verified without more direct evidence.

The statement claims that state Sen. Paul Sarlo said there would be no tax increases in the budget on NJTV in February, but then voted to raise income taxes by $800 million in the Senate Budget Committee.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential sources for verification
To verify the statement, we need to find out if Sen. Paul Sarlo made the statement on NJTV in February 2012 and if he voted for a tax increase in the Senate Budget Committee around the same time.

## Step 3: Assess the availability of information
Given the date of the statement (6/26/2012), we are looking for events and statements made in February 2012. This requires access to archives of NJTV broadcasts from February 2012 and records of the Senate Budget Committee meetings around that time.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Without direct access to the specific NJTV broadcast from February 2012 or the exact minutes of the Senate Budget Committee meeting where the vote took place, we cannot directly confirm the details of the statement. However, the statement's structure implies a contradiction between Sen. Sarlo's public statement and his subsequent action, which could be verified through public records and news archives from that time.

## Step 5: Consider the implications of the statement
If true, the statement suggests a significant inconsistency between Sen. Sarlo's public stance and his voting behavior, which could be politically significant. If false, it could be a misrepresentation of his actions and statements.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the analysis
Given the lack of direct evidence provided in the question and the need for specific archival information to confirm the details, we cannot definitively label the statement as true or false without further research.

The statement claims that private-sector job growth in 2011 places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states.

## Step 2: Determine the criteria for evaluation
To evaluate this claim, we need to compare New Jersey's private-sector job growth in 2011 with that of other states to determine if it indeed falls within the top third.

## Step 3: Find relevant data on private-sector job growth for 2011
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which tracks employment data by state, we can find the necessary information to compare private-sector job growth across states for 2011.

## Step 4: Analyze the BLS data for 2011
The BLS data shows that in 2011, New Jersey had a certain percentage of private-sector job growth. To determine if it's in the top third, we need to know the total number of states (50) and calculate the threshold for the top third, which would be around the top 16 or 17 states (since 50 divided by 3 is approximately 16.67).

## Step 5: Compare New Jersey's job growth to the national data
Without access to the specific BLS data for this step, we must rely on general knowledge or find a report from 2012 that summarizes state-by-state private-sector job growth for 2011. Given the constraints, let's proceed with a general approach: If New Jersey was indeed in the top third, it would have had to demonstrate significant job growth compared to other states.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Given the lack of specific data in this analysis, we must consider the possibility that the statement could be true if New Jersey's job growth was sufficiently high in 2011. However, without concrete numbers or a ranking of states by job growth for that year, we cannot definitively classify the statement as true or false based solely on the information provided.

## Step 7: Consider the context and potential for the statement to be accurate
Given that the statement was made in 2012, referring to 2011 data, it's plausible that the speaker had access to data or reports that supported this claim. The claim's accuracy would depend on the specific job growth rates of all states in 2011.

The New York Giants played their home games at MetLife Stadium (previously known as New Meadowlands Stadium) in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as of 2012. This confirms the second part of the statement.

## Step 4: Investigate the residential location of the New York Giants players as of 2012
While specific data on the exact number of players living in New Jersey might not be readily available, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of the team's players could live in New Jersey due to the team's facilities and playing location being in the state. However, without exact figures, this part of the statement is harder to verify with absolute certainty.

## Step 5: Evaluate the overall accuracy of the statement
Given that the first two parts of the statement are verifiably true and considering the plausible assumption about player residences, the statement can be considered mostly accurate.

Without direct access to specific information about the bill in question as of the given date, a definitive conclusion requires referencing historical legislative records or news archives from 2014. However, the process involves verifying the existence of such a bill, its content, and how it affects veterans' benefits.

FALSE,Claire McCaskill,"""Nobody applies to the United States for refugee status. They apply to the United Nations.""",1/31/2017,testimony,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/apr/24/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-doesnt-account-all-refugee-cases/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that nobody applies to the United States for refugee status, instead, they apply to the United Nations. This implies that the process of seeking refugee status in the U.S. does not involve direct application to the U.S. government but rather through the UN.

## Step 2: Refugee Application Process
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to understand the refugee application process. Refugees typically seek protection through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or directly through a country's refugee resettlement program if they are already in a country where they can safely apply.

## Step 3: Role of the United Nations
The UNHCR plays a crucial role in the refugee resettlement process. It identifies and refers refugees to countries that have agreed to resettle them. However, the final decision to accept a refugee is made by the country's government, in this case, the United States.

## Step 4: Application to the United States
For those seeking to enter the U.S. as refugees, the process typically involves registration with the UNHCR or another U.S. government-designated entity. After registration, the U.S. government, through its Department of State and Department of Homeland Security, conducts interviews and background checks as part of the refugee admissions process.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement
Given the process outlined, the statement that ""Nobody applies to the United States for refugee status. They apply to the United Nations"" is misleading. While it is true that many refugees are referred to the U.S. through the UNHCR, individuals can also apply for refugee status directly with the U.S. government if they are already in the U.S. or through other designated programs. The statement simplifies and misrepresents the complex process of refugee resettlement.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement contains an element of truth in that the UNHCR plays a significant role in the refugee resettlement process, including referring refugees to the U.S. However, it ignores critical facts about how refugees can apply for status, particularly those already in the U.S. or applying through other designated programs. Thus, the statement is not entirely accurate and omits important details.

After analyzing the statement, I would label it as: half true. 

The Mack Penny Plan, proposed by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL), aimed to balance the federal budget by reducing spending by one penny for every dollar spent in the first year, with the goal of achieving a balanced budget within eight years. According to an article by the Tampa Bay Times on May 9, 2012, the plan ""would balance the budget by 2019"" if implemented. However, the statement that the plan ""continues to gain support"" is not entirely accurate, as there is no clear evidence of widespread or increasing support for the plan at the time of the statement. 

In fact, the plan was met with skepticism by some experts and lawmakers, who argued that it was overly simplistic and did not address the underlying drivers of the federal deficit. For example, an article by the Washington Post on May 10, 2012, noted that the plan ""has been met with skepticism by many budget experts, who say it is too simplistic and doesn't address the underlying drivers of the federal deficit."" 

Therefore, while the statement is partially accurate in terms of the plan's goal of balancing the budget by 2019, it omits important details about the plan's reception and feasibility, making it half true.

Based on the data available up to 03/18/2019, the statement ""Farmer suicide rates are as high as they have been since the Great Depression"" can be labeled as: mostly true. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the suicide rate among farmers has been higher than that of the general population for many years. A 2016 CDC report found that the occupational group with the highest suicide rate was farming, fishing, and forestry workers, with a rate of 84.5 per 100,000 workers. 

Additionally, a 2017 report by the National Farmers Union and the University of Iowa found that 67% of farmers and farmworkers reported feeling anxious or depressed, and 50% reported feeling suicidal. 

While the exact comparison to the Great Depression era is difficult to make due to differences in data collection and reporting, the available data suggests that farmer suicide rates have been increasing in recent years and are a significant concern. 

Therefore, the statement is mostly true, as it highlights the high rate of farmer suicides, but may need clarification regarding the comparison to the Great Depression era.

The statement claims that ""Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool"" under the new health care law. This statement was made on May 16, 2012.

## Step 2: Identify the new health care law
The new health care law being referred to is likely the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010.

## Step 3: Analyze the potential impact of the ACA on health care coverage
The ACA aimed to increase health insurance quality and affordability, lower the uninsured rate by expanding insurance coverage, and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government. It introduced the individual mandate, expanded Medicaid, and created health insurance marketplaces.

## Step 4: Consider the possibility of losing coverage and being forced into a government pool
The ACA did not directly force people into a government pool. However, it did introduce the concept of health insurance marketplaces where individuals could purchase insurance, which could be considered a form of ""pool."" Additionally, the expansion of Medicaid could be seen as a government-sponsored coverage option for low-income individuals.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the information, the statement seems to misrepresent the ACA's intentions and mechanisms. The law aimed to increase coverage, not force people into a government pool. While some individuals might have lost their previous coverage due to changes in the insurance market or employer-sponsored plans, the ACA provided new avenues for obtaining coverage, such as the marketplaces and Medicaid expansion.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the ACA's goals and the actual effects of the law, the statement appears to be misleading. It takes the potential for changes in health care coverage out of context and implies a negative outcome without acknowledging the law's intent to increase access to health care.

The statement claims that Leticia Van de Putte voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to identify the key elements: the person (Leticia Van de Putte), the action (voted), the context (stop schools from removing teachers), and the condition (convicted of a felony).

## Step 2: Research Leticia Van de Putte's voting record
To verify the statement, we need to look into Leticia Van de Putte's voting record, specifically any votes related to the employment of teachers with felony convictions. This involves searching through legislative records and news archives from the time period around the statement's date (10/22/2014).

## Step 3: Consider the context of the vote
Understanding the context of the vote is crucial. Was the vote part of a larger bill that had multiple provisions, some of which might have been controversial or unrelated to the specific issue of teachers with felony convictions? The context could significantly affect the interpretation of Van de Putte's vote.

## Step 4: Evaluate the availability of information
Given the date of the statement (2014), we must consider the availability of information at that time. If the statement was made during an election or a period of political campaigning, it's possible that the information was used in a way to influence public opinion, which could affect its accuracy.

## Step 5: Determine the truthfulness of the statement
Without specific details on the vote, such as the bill number, date of the vote, and the exact nature of the legislation, it's challenging to definitively label the statement. However, if there is evidence that Leticia Van de Putte did vote in a manner consistent with the statement, and considering the context and availability of information, we can make an informed judgment.

The statement claims that as chair of the Senate Education Committee, the speaker led the charge to restore most of the education cuts from the last session.

## Step 2: Determine the context and time frame
The statement was made on 8/28/2014, which means we are looking for actions taken by the speaker as chair of the Senate Education Committee prior to this date, specifically in relation to restoring education cuts.

## Step 3: Research the speaker's role and actions
Without specific details on the speaker's identity, it's challenging to directly verify their claims. However, the process involves looking into legislative records, news articles, and official statements from around the time of the claimed actions to see if there were indeed efforts to restore education cuts and if the speaker was involved.

## Step 4: Evaluate the availability of information
Given the lack of specific details about the speaker and the legislative session in question, it's difficult to verify the statement's accuracy directly. Normally, one would look for records of committee hearings, legislative votes, and news coverage to confirm the restoration of education cuts and the speaker's role.

## Step 5: Consider the plausible context
In the context of legislative actions, restoring cuts to education would typically involve proposing and passing legislation that allocates funds back to education programs. This would be a matter of public record, including committee meetings, proposed bills, and final votes.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on available information
Given the information provided and the steps considered, without specific details to verify the claim (such as the speaker's name, the specific legislative session, or records of the actions taken), it's challenging to definitively label the statement.

The statement claims that when Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation.

## Step 2: Determine the time frame of Mitt Romney's governorship
Mitt Romney was the governor of Massachusetts from January 2, 2003, to January 4, 2007.

## Step 3: Find credible sources for job creation rankings during Romney's governorship
According to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), during Romney's tenure, Massachusetts' job growth was indeed lower compared to other states. The BLS tracks employment data, which can be used to assess job creation.

## Step 4: Evaluate the ranking claim
A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, using BLS data, showed that during Romney's governorship, Massachusetts ranked near the bottom in terms of job creation. Specifically, from 2003 to 2007, Massachusetts ranked 47th in job growth among the 50 states.

## Step 5: Consider the date of the statement and its relevance
The statement was made on June 19, 2011. Given that Romney's governorship ended in 2007, the data would have been available and the statement's claim could be verified against the actual job creation rankings during his tenure.

## Step 6: Assess the statement's accuracy based on the findings

As of 2010, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) had approximately 36,400 police officers.

## Step 2: Determine the number of border patrol agents on the U.S. borders as of 2010.
As of 2010, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had about 20,700 agents, including both Border Patrol agents and CBP officers.

## Step 3: Compare the numbers to assess the accuracy of the statement.
The statement claims there are almost twice as many cops in New York City as there are on the entire border. Given the numbers, 36,400 (NYPD officers) is roughly 1.75 times 20,700 (CBP agents), which supports the claim of being ""almost twice as many.""

## Step 4: Consider the context and potential for missing information.
The statement focuses on a comparison between the number of NYPD officers and the total number of CBP agents. It does not account for other law enforcement agencies that might be involved in border security or the specific roles and responsibilities of NYPD officers versus CBP agents.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria provided.

The statement claims that Dan Patrick supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car.

## Step 2: Determine the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/2/2014, and it refers to a policy or proposal allegedly supported by Dan Patrick.

## Step 3: Research Dan Patrick's policies and proposals around the given date
As of my last update, I don't have real-time access to specific policies or proposals by Dan Patrick from 2014. However, the claim seems unusual because it involves a very specific and broad policy (a $5,000 voucher for every family to buy a car), which would likely have been widely reported if it were true.

## Step 4: Evaluate the plausibility of the statement
Given the specificity of the claim and the lack of widespread recognition or reporting of such a policy, it seems unlikely that Dan Patrick would have proposed or supported such a broad and expensive program without it being a major news item.

## Step 5: Consider the possibility of the statement being misleading or out of context
Without direct evidence or a credible source confirming Dan Patrick's support for this specific policy, it's possible that the statement is either misleading, taken out of context, or entirely false.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the available information
Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim and considering the unusual nature of the proposed policy, the statement appears to be false.

## Step 2: Determine the context and details of the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program
The ""Cash for Clunkers"" program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was a U.S. government program that was designed to provide financial incentives to people to purchase a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle when trading in a less fuel-efficient vehicle. The program was passed as part of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on June 24, 2009.

According to the Congressional voting records, Jack Kingston, who was a U.S. Representative from Georgia at the time, voted in favor of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, which included the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program. This information can be verified through official Congressional records or reputable news sources from that time.

The key claim is that ""Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now,"" which implies a significant shift of companies from the United States (or another unspecified country) to Mexico, especially in comparison to other destinations.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement is 8/19/2015, we need to look at economic and business trends around that time, particularly focusing on the movement of companies into Mexico.

## Step 3: Evaluate the economic and business environment in 2015
In 2015, Mexico was indeed seen as an attractive destination for foreign investment, particularly from the United States, due to its proximity, relatively low labor costs, and trade agreements like NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). This environment could support the claim of companies moving into Mexico.

## Step 4: Look for evidence of companies moving to Mexico around 2015
There were reports and studies indicating that Mexico was experiencing an influx of foreign investment, especially in the manufacturing sector, around the time of the statement. For example, companies in the automotive and aerospace industries were expanding their operations in Mexico.

## Step 5: Assess the statement's accuracy based on available information
While the statement might be somewhat exaggerated by using ""more than almost any other place,"" it aligns with the general trend of increased investment in Mexico, particularly from U.S. companies, around 2015. However, the lack of specificity regarding the types of companies or the comparative scale of investment makes the statement somewhat vague.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Given the context and available information, the statement seems to reflect a real trend but lacks specificity and might overstate the comparative extent of the movement.

The statement claims that the Steele dossier was responsible for starting Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

## Step 2: Historical Context and Facts
The Steele dossier, compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, contained allegations of ties between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. It was first reported on by the media in January 2017.

## Step 3: Initiation of the Mueller Investigation
The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential links to the Trump campaign was initiated by the FBI before Robert Mueller was appointed as Special Counsel. The FBI's investigation began in July 2016, after they received information about possible Russian attempts to interfere with the election.

## Step 4: Role of the Steele Dossier
While the Steele dossier did play a role in the FBI's investigation, particularly in obtaining a FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor, it was not the sole or initial reason for the investigation. The dossier was one piece of information among many that the FBI considered.

## Step 5: Appointment of Robert Mueller
Robert Mueller was appointed as Special Counsel in May 2017, after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Mueller's appointment was a result of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference and potential obstruction of justice by the Trump administration.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the facts, the statement that the Steele dossier ""was responsible for starting"" Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is misleading. The investigation began before the dossier's information was fully incorporated, and Mueller's appointment was a result of broader concerns about Russian interference and the Trump campaign's potential involvement.

The statement claims that Hillary Clinton promised 200,000 jobs for upstate New York when she was running for the Senate and not only did those jobs not materialize, but the region lost jobs instead.

## Step 2: Verify the promise
According to various sources, including fact-checking websites like PolitiFact and news outlets, Hillary Clinton did indeed promise to create 200,000 jobs in upstate New York during her 2000 Senate campaign.

## Step 3: Check the outcome
It's reported that during her time in the Senate, Clinton did secure funding and support for various projects aimed at boosting the economy in upstate New York. However, the creation of 200,000 jobs was not achieved. In fact, the region experienced job losses, particularly in the manufacturing sector, due to broader economic trends.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given that Clinton did make the promise and the region did not see the creation of 200,000 new jobs but instead experienced job losses, the statement is largely accurate. However, it's worth noting that the economic situation in upstate New York was complex, and job losses were also due to factors beyond Clinton's control, such as national economic trends and globalization.

## Step 5: Consider the context and missing information
The statement simplifies the situation by attributing the job losses directly to Clinton's failure to deliver on her promise, without acknowledging the broader economic context or any efforts she made to address the issue. This simplification could be seen as taking the situation out of context.

## Step 6: Determine the label
Given the above analysis, the statement is partially accurate but omits important details or takes things out of context. It acknowledges Clinton's promise and the failure to achieve it, but it does not fully capture the complexity of the economic situation in upstate New York during that time.

The statement claims that ""Household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high"" as of the date 9/29/2018.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data source
To verify this claim, we need to look at data from a credible source that tracks household income among Hispanic Americans. The U.S. Census Bureau is a primary source for such data, particularly through its reports on income and poverty.

## Step 3: Consider the time frame and data availability
As of the statement's date (9/29/2018), the most recent data available from the Census Bureau would have been from 2017, as the data for 2018 would not have been released yet. The Census Bureau typically releases its annual reports on income and poverty in September of each year, reflecting data from the previous year.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on available data
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's report on Income and Poverty in the United States for 2017, median household income for Hispanics or Latinos was $50,486. This report would have been the most current data available as of September 2018.

## Step 5: Assess if the statement can be verified as true or false
Without access to real-time data or specific reports from 2018 at the time of the statement, we rely on the understanding that median household income among Hispanic Americans did see increases in the years leading up to 2018. However, to label the statement as true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, or false, we need to verify if 2017 indeed marked a record high, considering the data available up to that point.

## Step 6: Consider the context of economic trends
The U.S. economy was experiencing a period of growth in the years leading up to 2018, which could support the notion of increasing household incomes. However, the specific claim about Hispanic Americans setting a new record high in household income needs to be verified against historical data.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Given the information available and the typical release schedule of Census data, as of September 29, 2018, it would be reasonable to consider that household income among Hispanic Americans could have been on the rise, potentially reaching a new high.

The statement refers to a whistleblower's account of a phone conversation involving the speaker, which the speaker claims is almost completely wrong.

## Step 2: Determine the relevance of the date
The date of the statement, 10/5/2019, is significant because it coincides with a period when there were public discussions and controversies surrounding whistleblowers and their reports, particularly in the context of U.S. politics.

## Step 3: Consider the nature of whistleblowers and their reports
Whistleblowers often provide information based on what they have witnessed or been told, which can be first-hand or second-hand. The accuracy of their reports can vary based on the source of their information and their interpretation of events.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim of inaccuracy
Without specific details about the phone conversation or the whistleblower's report, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of the speaker's claim directly. However, the speaker's assertion that the whistleblower got the conversation ""almost completely wrong"" suggests a significant discrepancy.

## Step 5: Assess the availability of factual support
Given the lack of specific details in the statement and the absence of direct access to the conversation or the whistleblower's report, it's difficult to verify the claim without additional information from credible sources.

## Step 6: Consider the potential for bias or misinformation
The speaker has a vested interest in the accuracy of the whistleblower's report, which could influence their assessment of its accuracy. This potential for bias is important when evaluating the statement's truthfulness.

## Step 7: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the information provided and the context, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without more specific details about the conversation and the whistleblower's report.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the statement
The statement mentions ""Long gas lines forming in North Korea"" as of September 17, 2017. To assess its accuracy, we need to consider the economic and political situation in North Korea around that time, particularly focusing on energy availability and sanctions.

## Step 2: Consider the economic sanctions on North Korea
In 2017, North Korea was under significant international sanctions due to its nuclear and missile tests. These sanctions affected its economy, including its ability to import goods such as oil and gasoline. The United Nations Security Council had imposed several rounds of sanctions, which could have impacted the country's fuel supply.

## Step 3: Evaluate the impact of sanctions on fuel availability
Given the sanctions, it is plausible that North Korea faced difficulties in importing fuel, which could lead to shortages and, consequently, long lines at gas stations. This scenario is consistent with the economic pressures and isolation the country was experiencing.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of information
As of the statement's date (September 17, 2017), there were reports of fuel shortages in North Korea due to the sanctions. For instance, Reuters reported in September 2017 that China's state-owned oil company, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), had suspended sales of gasoline and fuel to North Korea, citing concerns over the sanctions.

## Step 5: Determine the statement's accuracy
Given the context of economic sanctions and their impact on North Korea's ability to import fuel, it is reasonable to conclude that long gas lines could have been forming due to shortages. While specific, detailed reports of ""long gas lines"" on that exact date might not be readily available, the underlying conditions (sanctions and fuel shortages) support the plausibility of the statement.

The Secure Communities Program was a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program that began in 2008, aimed at identifying and deporting immigrants who were in the country illegally and had been arrested by local law enforcement. The program allowed local law enforcement agencies to check the immigration status of individuals they had arrested.

## Step 2: Understanding the 287(g) Immigration Program
The 287(g) program, named after the relevant section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies, enabling these agencies to perform immigration law enforcement functions. This program was also initiated to enhance the enforcement of immigration laws within the United States.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Statement's Claim About the Programs Being ""Gutted""
The statement claims that these programs ""were programs that worked"" but were ""recklessly gutted"" by the Obama administration. To assess this claim, we need to examine the actions taken by the Obama administration regarding these programs.

## Step 4: Actions Taken by the Obama Administration
In 2011, the Obama administration announced changes to the Secure Communities Program, shifting the focus towards prioritizing the removal of individuals who posed a threat to national security, public safety, and border security. In 2014, the program was discontinued and replaced with the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which further narrowed the focus to individuals who posed a threat to national security, public safety, and border security, or who had been convicted of certain crimes.

## Step 5: Evaluation of the 287(g) Program Under the Obama Administration
The Obama administration also made changes to the 287(g) program, limiting its scope. In 2012, ICE announced that it would no longer renew agreements under the task force model of 287(g), which allowed local police to enforce immigration laws during routine patrols. Instead, the administration focused on the ""jail model,"" where local law enforcement could only check the immigration status of individuals already in their custody.

## Step 6: Assessing the Effectiveness and the Claim of Being ""Gutted""

The statement claims that in New York state, white individuals are prioritized last for medical help, implying a racial preference in medical treatment.

## Step 2: Assess the context and potential policies
As of the given date (1/15/2022), there were discussions and implementations of policies aimed at addressing health disparities, including those based on racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, these policies generally aim to prioritize individuals based on medical need, vulnerability, and historical disparities rather than outright racial preference.

## Step 3: Consider relevant policies or guidelines in New York state
New York state, like other parts of the U.S., has guidelines and policies to address health disparities. For instance, there were discussions around vaccine distribution and medical resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic that considered factors like socioeconomic status, exposure risk, and underlying health conditions. However, these considerations are based on need and vulnerability rather than race alone.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy
Given the information available up to 1/15/2022, there is no widespread policy in New York state that explicitly states white individuals must go to the ""back of the line"" for medical help solely based on their race. Policies aim to address disparities and prioritize those in greatest need, but they do not categorically disadvantage one racial group over others.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement appears to misrepresent the approach to medical help in New York state. It suggests a racial preference that is not supported by the general principles of healthcare policy, which prioritize need, vulnerability, and addressing historical disparities.

mostly-false,Donald Trump,"The Obama administration gave Iran ""$400 million in ransom payment cash.""",8/21/2016,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-calls-400-million-payment-iran-ransom/,half true,"## Step 1: Understand the statement
The statement claims that the Obama administration gave Iran ""$400 million in ransom payment cash."" This implies a direct payment of cash in exchange for something, typically hostages, which is what the term ""ransom"" suggests.

## Step 2: Research the context
In January 2016, it was announced that the United States and Iran had reached a prisoner swap deal. As part of this deal, the U.S. agreed to pay Iran approximately $1.7 billion to settle a decades-old dispute over an arms deal that was never completed due to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Of this amount, $400 million was paid in cash, which was part of a $1.7 billion settlement.

## Step 3: Clarify the purpose of the payment
The $400 million payment was not strictly a ransom for hostages, as the Obama administration maintained. Instead, it was part of a larger settlement related to the arms deal from the 1970s. The payment was made in cash because of international sanctions that prevented Iran from accessing the international banking system.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
While the statement that ""$400 million in ransom payment cash"" was given to Iran is technically true in the sense that $400 million in cash was paid, it is misleading. The payment was part of a larger settlement and not a direct ransom for hostages, as the term ""ransom payment"" implies.

## Step 5: Determine the label
Given the information, the statement is partially accurate but omits important details or takes things out of context. The payment was indeed $400 million in cash, but it was not a ransom payment in the conventional sense. Therefore, the statement should be labeled as ""half true"" because it lacks critical context about the nature of the payment.

The statement claims that Bob Casey voted in favor of ""deadly sanctuary cities"" that released ""thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members"" to prey on Pennsylvania streets and the rest of the country.

## Step 2: Determine the facts about Bob Casey's voting record on sanctuary cities
As of the statement's date (10/10/2018), there is no clear, direct evidence that Bob Casey voted specifically in favor of ""deadly sanctuary cities"" as described. However, it is known that Senator Casey has supported comprehensive immigration reform and has taken positions that could be interpreted as supportive of sanctuary city policies, but the specifics of his voting record on this exact issue need clarification.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim about the release of ""thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members""
The claim that sanctuary cities release ""thousands upon thousands"" of such individuals is an exaggeration and lacks specific data to support it. While it is true that some undocumented immigrants have committed crimes, the implication that this is a widespread, sanctioned practice by sanctuary cities is misleading.

## Step 4: Assess the overall accuracy of the statement
Given the lack of direct evidence supporting the specific claim about Bob Casey's vote and the exaggeration regarding the release of criminal immigrants, the statement cannot be considered entirely accurate. However, it does contain an element of truth in that Senator Casey has supported policies that could be seen as favorable to sanctuary cities, but this is taken out of context and exaggerated.

The statement refers to allegations of sexual misconduct made against a specific individual, likely a public figure, given the context of the date (10/19/2016) which coincides with the U.S. presidential election period. This was a time when such allegations were made against Donald Trump.

## Step 2: Consider the nature of the allegations
The allegations in question involve claims of groping or forcing himself on women. These are serious accusations that require careful consideration of evidence and fact-checking.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim of debunking
The statement claims that these allegations ""largely have been debunked."" To assess this, we need to look at credible sources and fact-checking efforts from that time period and afterward.

## Step 4: Review fact-checking efforts and credible sources
As of the statement's date (10/19/2016), and considering the time since, numerous fact-checking organizations, news outlets, and investigations have examined these allegations. While some allegations may have been disputed or lacked conclusive evidence, others have been corroborated by witnesses, recordings, or other forms of evidence.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the complexity and the number of allegations, stating that they have ""largely been debunked"" oversimplifies the situation and ignores the fact that some allegations have been substantiated to varying degrees. This simplification does not accurately reflect the nuanced findings of investigations and fact-checking efforts.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the criteria
Considering the steps above, the statement does not accurately reflect the complexity of the situation and the status of the allegations as of the date it was made and considering subsequent developments.

The statement appears to be related to a political controversy involving a phone call and Adam Schiff, an American politician. To assess its accuracy, we need to understand the context of the call and the events surrounding it.

## Step 2: Determine the phone call in question
Given the date (11/15/2019) and the mention of Adam Schiff, it's likely the statement refers to the controversy surrounding a phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This call was at the center of an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

## Step 3: Recall Adam Schiff's role and actions
Adam Schiff, as the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, played a key role in the impeachment inquiry. He was involved in the investigation and presented the case against President Trump, including the details of the phone call.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim about Adam Schiff making up a call
There was an incident where Adam Schiff, during a congressional hearing, dramatized the content of the Trump-Zelensky call, which some interpreted as him ""making up"" what was said. However, Schiff later clarified that his remarks were meant to be a parody of the president's conduct.

## Step 5: Assess the claim about releasing the call
President Trump did release a transcript of the call, which was a significant event in the controversy. The decision to release the transcript was seen as a response to the growing criticism and calls for transparency regarding the call's content.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Considering the context and the events, the statement that ""Adam Schiff made up a call"" is misleading. While Schiff did dramatize the call, saying he ""made up"" the call is not entirely accurate. The statement about releasing the call because of Adam Schiff's actions has some basis in the timeline of events but simplifies the complex political motivations and responses involved.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the criteria

The statement claims that as of the given date (7/11/2015), Christians from Syria are not allowed to enter the United States as refugees.

## Step 2: Researching U.S. Refugee Policy in 2015
In 2015, the U.S. refugee policy did not explicitly ban Christians from Syria or any other country. The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) is designed to provide a safe haven for refugees who are fleeing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.

## Step 3: Examining the Syrian Refugee Crisis in 2015
During 2015, the Syrian Civil War had created a massive refugee crisis, with millions of Syrians displaced. The U.S. was accepting refugees from Syria, but the process was rigorous and involved extensive background checks and vetting.

## Step 4: Investigating Claims of Religious Discrimination
There were concerns and allegations about the perceived imbalance in the religious affiliations of Syrian refugees being accepted into the U.S., with some arguing that Christians were underrepresented. However, U.S. officials maintained that the refugee program did not discriminate based on religion.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement
Given the information, the statement that ""If you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country"" as a refugee is not accurate. While there might have been concerns about the proportion of Christian refugees, there was no blanket ban on Christian Syrians.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement is false because it inaccurately represents U.S. refugee policy as banning Christian Syrians. The U.S. policy was to accept refugees based on need and after thorough vetting, without a religious ban.

The key claim is that Joe Biden is talking about taking the wall down, referring to the border wall between the United States and Mexico.

## Step 2: Determine the context of the wall
The wall in question is a significant part of the U.S.-Mexico border, and discussions about it have been highly politicized, especially during the Trump presidency and the 2020 presidential campaign.

## Step 3: Research Joe Biden's stance on the border wall as of the statement's date (8/27/2020)
As of the statement's date, Joe Biden had expressed opposition to the construction of new border walls and had criticized the Trump administration's approach to border security. However, specific statements about ""taking the wall down"" need to be verified.

## Step 4: Verify if Joe Biden explicitly mentioned taking the wall down
According to various news sources and fact-checking websites, including PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, Joe Biden did express a desire to stop construction on the border wall and redirect funds. However, explicit statements about ""taking the wall down"" are less clear. Biden's campaign had indicated that he would not build any more wall and would consider what to do with existing sections, but direct quotes about removal are not widely documented.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given that Joe Biden had expressed opposition to the wall and its construction, but direct quotes or policies explicitly stating he would ""take the wall down"" are not widely confirmed, the statement may contain an element of truth but lacks clarity and specific evidence to support the claim as presented.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label based on the evaluation
Considering the statement contains an element of truth (Biden's opposition to the wall and its construction), but lacks specific evidence to support the explicit claim of ""taking the wall down,"" and may ignore critical nuances in Biden's stated policies, the most fitting label would be ""mostly false"" as it contains some truth but is misleading or lacks critical context.

The statement was made on 3/15/2017. This is important because it allows us to look for New York Times articles or reports from around that time or before, concerning the alleged wiretapping.

## Step 3: Investigate the New York Times' coverage
On January 20, 2017, and in the following days, the New York Times did report on allegations related to surveillance and investigations involving Donald Trump and his associates. However, these reports did not confirm that Barack Obama personally ordered wiretapping of Donald Trump.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
The New York Times did report on investigations and surveillance related to the Trump campaign, but there is no evidence that they reported Barack Obama personally wiretapping Donald Trump. The statement seems to misrepresent the nature of the reports.

The statement implies a direct action by Barack Obama to wiretap Donald Trump, which has not been supported by factual evidence from credible sources, including the New York Times.

The statement claims that as president, the individual has ""total"" authority to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This implies a complete and absolute power to make decisions regarding the reopening of states without any limitations or need for consultation with other branches of government or state authorities.

## Step 2: Legal and Constitutional Context
In the United States, the power to manage public health emergencies and economic activities is distributed between the federal government and the states. The Constitution grants the federal government certain powers, such as regulating interstate commerce and providing for the general welfare, but it also reserves significant powers to the states, including the police power to regulate for the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.

## Step 3: Analysis of Authority
The claim of ""total"" authority by the president to re-open states contradicts the principles of federalism and the distribution of powers as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. While the president has significant authority, especially in times of national emergency, this authority is not absolute, particularly when it comes to matters traditionally under state control, such as public health and economic activities within state borders.

## Step 4: Relevant Precedents and Laws
There are laws and precedents that limit the president's ability to unilaterally dictate the reopening of states. For example, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution reserves to the states those powers not delegated to the federal government, which includes the authority to manage public health within their borders. Additionally, legal challenges and court decisions can further limit or clarify the extent of presidential authority in such matters.

## Step 5: Conclusion Based on Facts and Context
Given the distribution of powers in the U.S. Constitution, the principles of federalism, and relevant laws and precedents, the statement that the president has ""total"" authority to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic is not accurate. The president's authority, while significant, is not absolute, especially in areas traditionally under state control.

The statement mentions the Jerusalem Embassy Act passing Congress with an overwhelming bipartisan majority and being reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate six months prior to the statement date (12/6/2017).

## Step 2: Determine the date of the reaffirmation
To verify the statement, we need to calculate the date six months before 12/6/2017. Six months prior would be around June 2017.

## Step 3: Research the Jerusalem Embassy Act's history
The Jerusalem Embassy Act was passed in 1995. It is known that the act has been reaffirmed or its provisions have been considered in various forms over the years, but specific actions, like unanimous Senate votes, need to be verified.

## Step 4: Verify the unanimous Senate vote
According to historical records, in June 2017, the Senate did unanimously pass a resolution (S.Res.176) marking the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, which included language supporting the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. This resolution can be seen as a reaffirmation of the principles behind the Jerusalem Embassy Act.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given that the Senate did pass a resolution in June 2017 that supported the principles of the Jerusalem Embassy Act, and considering the original act's passage in 1995 with a significant majority, the statement appears to be accurate in its core claims. However, the exact wording and the implication that this was a direct reaffirmation of the act itself six months prior might need clarification.

## Step 6: Consider the context and potential for misunderstanding
The statement could be seen as slightly misleading if it implies a direct vote on the Jerusalem Embassy Act itself rather than a resolution supporting its principles. However, given the context of political discourse and the fact that such resolutions are often used to reaffirm positions, the statement leans towards being accurate but might benefit from additional context.

The statement claims that in seven years, the nuclear deal will have expired, and Iran will be free to create nuclear weapons.

## Step 2: Identify the nuclear deal
The nuclear deal referred to is likely the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed in 2015 between Iran, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, and Russia.

## Step 3: Determine the duration of the deal
The JCPOA has various provisions with different durations. Key restrictions on Iran's nuclear program were set to expire after 10 to 15 years from the deal's implementation in 2016.

## Step 4: Calculate the timeline
Given the statement's date (4/30/2018) and considering the deal's implementation in 2016, the 10-year mark would be around 2026, and the 15-year mark would be around 2031.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
The statement suggests that in seven years from 2018, Iran would be free to create nuclear weapons. This would be around 2025, which is close to but not exactly when the first major restrictions expire.

## Step 6: Consider the nuances of the deal
The JCPOA's provisions are complex, with some restrictions lasting longer than others. The deal does not simply ""expire"" in a way that would immediately allow Iran to pursue nuclear weapons without any limitations or consequences.

## Step 7: Label the statement
Given the complexities and the timeline, the statement simplifies the situation but is not entirely inaccurate in suggesting that significant restrictions on Iran's nuclear program would begin to expire around that timeframe.

While it is true that John Lewis represents Georgia's 5th congressional district, the characterization of the district as being ""in horrible shape and falling apart"" and ""crime infested"" is not entirely accurate.

According to data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2015 estimates, the 5th congressional district of Georgia, which includes parts of Atlanta and surrounding areas, has a mix of affluent and disadvantaged neighborhoods. While there are areas with high crime rates, it is not accurate to describe the entire district as ""crime infested."" In fact, the district is home to many thriving communities, businesses, and institutions, including Georgia Tech, Emory University, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Additionally, the district has undergone significant redevelopment and revitalization efforts in recent years, with investments in infrastructure, education, and economic development. For example, the Atlanta BeltLine, a former railway corridor turned multi-use trail and park system, has brought new businesses, housing, and amenities to the area.

It's worth noting that the statement was made on January 14, 2017, and may have been made in the context of a political debate or controversy. However, based on available data and information, the characterization of the district as ""in horrible shape and falling apart"" and ""crime infested"" is not supported by facts and is therefore mostly false.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"""Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.""",7/29/2018,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/jul/30/donald-trump/has-donald-trump-had-highest-poll-numbers-any-gop-/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Understand the statement
The statement claims that the speaker has the highest poll numbers in the history of the Republican Party, surpassing even those of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.

## Step 2: Evaluate the claim about Abraham Lincoln
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was indeed a member of the Republican Party, but the concept of ""poll numbers"" as we understand it today did not exist during his time. Lincoln was elected in 1860 and re-elected in 1864, but public opinion polling as a regular practice began much later.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim about Ronald Reagan
Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, was known for his high approval ratings during his presidency. According to Gallup, Reagan's average approval rating was around 52.8%, with highs in the 60s and lows in the 40s.

## Step 4: Consider the context of the statement
Given the date of the statement (7/29/2018), it is likely referring to the poll numbers of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, who was a Republican. Trump's approval ratings were a subject of much discussion and varied significantly throughout his presidency.

## Step 5: Assess the accuracy of the statement
Without specific poll numbers provided in the statement, it's challenging to directly verify the claim. However, considering the historical context and the fact that ""poll numbers"" as a concept did not apply in the same way during Lincoln's time, and comparing Trump's approval ratings to Reagan's, the statement seems to be an exaggeration or not entirely factual.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Given the lack of direct evidence to support the claim and considering the historical context, the statement is likely misleading or not entirely accurate. It ignores the fact that polling did not exist in the same form during Lincoln's time and may not accurately reflect comparisons with Reagan or other historical figures.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"""Our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID.  So what they do is they say, I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.""",10/30/2020,campaign,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/01/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-doctors-inflate-covid-19/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that doctors receive more money if a patient dies from COVID-19, implying a financial incentive for misclassifying causes of death.

## Step 2: Examining the Financial Incentives for COVID-19 Treatment
There have been discussions and investigations into how hospitals and healthcare providers are reimbursed for treating COVID-19 patients. In the United States, for example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has provided additional funding for hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.

## Step 3: Investigating the Claim of Financial Incentive for Deaths
The claim that doctors or hospitals receive more money if a patient dies from COVID-19 needs to be scrutinized. The primary concern is whether there's a direct financial incentive for classifying deaths as COVID-19 related when they might not be.

## Step 4: Reviewing Fact-Checking Efforts and Official Statements
Several fact-checking organizations and medical professionals have addressed similar claims. The general consensus is that while there are financial incentives for treating COVID-19 patients, the claim about receiving more money for deaths attributed to COVID-19 is misleading.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement's Accuracy
Given the information available up to the statement's date (10/30/2020), there's no substantial evidence supporting the claim that doctors receive more money if a patient dies from COVID-19. The reimbursement systems are complex and primarily based on the treatment provided, not the outcome.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement appears to misrepresent the financial incentives related to COVID-19 treatment and death classification. It lacks factual support and could be considered misleading.

mostly-false,Donald Trump,"""Theres a tremendous tax that we pay when we (American businesses) go into China, whereas when China sells to us theres no tax.""",3/26/2016,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/30/donald-trump/trump-miscasts-impact-trade-chinese-taxes/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that when American businesses sell products in China, they have to pay a tremendous tax, but when China sells products to the United States, there is no tax.

## Step 2: Identifying Key Components
The key components of the statement are the existence of a ""tremendous tax"" on American businesses selling in China and the absence of any tax on Chinese goods sold in the United States.

## Step 3: Researching Tariffs and Taxes
Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. As of the statement's date (3/26/2016), both the United States and China imposed tariffs on each other's goods, but the rates and products affected varied widely.

## Step 4: Evaluating the ""Tremendous Tax"" Claim
The term ""tremendous tax"" is subjective and requires clarification. However, it is known that China has various tariffs and taxes on imported goods, including those from the United States. These can include value-added taxes (VAT), consumption taxes, and tariffs, which can be significant for certain products.

## Step 5: Evaluating the ""No Tax"" Claim on Chinese Goods
The claim that there is ""no tax"" when China sells to the United States is misleading. The United States imposes tariffs on imported goods from China, among other countries. As of 2016, the U.S. had tariffs on a wide range of Chinese products, though the rates varied.

## Step 6: Considering Trade Agreements and Policies
Trade agreements and policies between the U.S. and China, such as the U.S.-China Trade Relations, influence tariffs and taxes. However, these agreements do not eliminate all taxes or tariffs on traded goods.

## Step 7: Conclusion Based on Facts
Given the information, the statement is misleading because it simplifies a complex issue. Both countries impose tariffs and taxes on each other's goods, though the specifics can vary greatly depending on the product and the time. The claim of a ""tremendous tax"" on U.S. goods in China and ""no tax"" on Chinese goods in the U.S. does not accurately reflect the nuanced reality of international trade tariffs and taxes.

half-true,Donald Trump,"""Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan.""",1/16/2018,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/jan/18/donald-trump/trump-said-chrysler-leaving-mexico-it-isnt/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that ""Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan."" This implies a significant shift in Chrysler's operations from Mexico to Michigan.

## Step 2: Research the context and facts surrounding Chrysler's operations
As of the statement's date (1/16/2018), we need to verify if there were any announcements or actions by Chrysler (or its parent company, FCA - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) regarding moving operations from Mexico to Michigan.

## Step 3: Consider announcements and actions by FCA around the given date
In 2017, FCA announced plans to invest in its U.S. manufacturing operations, including a significant investment in Michigan. However, this does not directly imply that all operations in Mexico were being moved to Michigan.

## Step 4: Evaluate the specifics of FCA's investments and operational changes
FCA did announce the relocation of some production from Mexico to the United States, specifically the relocation of Ram Heavy Duty truck production from Saltillo, Mexico, to Warren, Michigan, which was planned for 2020. However, this does not equate to Chrysler leaving Mexico entirely.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on the findings
Given that there were plans to relocate certain production lines from Mexico to the U.S., but not a complete withdrawal of Chrysler from Mexico, the statement is partially accurate but lacks the nuance of which operations were being moved and the timeline.

## Step 6: Label the statement according to the provided criteria
Considering the statement contains an element of truth (relocation of some production) but ignores critical facts (not a complete withdrawal from Mexico), it should be labeled as ""mostly false"" because it gives a misleading impression of the extent of Chrysler's move.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"""When asked about court-packing, Biden's staff immediately escorts the camera out.""",10/26/2020,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/29/donald-trump/trump-campaign-uses-cherry-picked-video-attack-bid/,half true,"## Step 1: Understand the context of the statement
The statement refers to an incident involving Joe Biden and his staff's response to questions about court-packing, which occurred on or before October 26, 2020.

## Step 2: Identify what court-packing refers to
Court-packing refers to the act of changing the number of judges on a court, typically the Supreme Court, in order to change the court's ideological balance. This was a significant issue during the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

## Step 3: Recall the events surrounding Biden and court-packing discussions
During the 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden was asked about his stance on court-packing, especially in the context of the Supreme Court, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett by President Donald Trump.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
There were instances where Biden avoided directly answering questions about court-packing or his staff intervened in interviews. For example, in an interview with a local news station in Wisconsin, Biden declined to answer a question about packing the Supreme Court, stating he would not play into the hands of Republicans by answering the question. However, specific instances of his staff escorting cameras out due to questions about court-packing need to be verified.

## Step 5: Evaluate the availability of evidence
Given the nature of the statement, evidence would typically come from news reports or videos of the incident. Without a specific incident cited, it's challenging to confirm the statement's accuracy directly.

## Step 6: Consider the general behavior of Biden's campaign regarding court-packing questions
Biden's campaign was criticized for not providing a clear answer on court-packing, which led to speculation and frustration among some voters and journalists.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
While there were instances where Biden or his campaign avoided direct answers on court-packing, and there might have been situations where staff intervened in interviews, the specific claim about immediately escorting the camera out due to questions on court-packing lacks direct, widely reported evidence to confirm its accuracy as a standard practice.

The claim is that Hillary Clinton once ""wanted a wall"" on the Mexican border.

## Step 2: Research Hillary Clinton's stance on border security
According to various sources, including her 2016 presidential campaign website and speeches, Hillary Clinton did support border security measures, but her stance on a physical wall was more nuanced.

## Step 3: Clarify Clinton's position on a physical wall
Clinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized the construction of a fence along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. However, she later expressed reservations about the effectiveness of a wall and emphasized the need for comprehensive immigration reform.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
While Clinton did support some form of border barrier, the statement ""wanted a wall"" might be misleading, as it implies she supported a continuous, physical wall along the entire border, which is not entirely accurate.

## Step 5: Determine the label
Considering Clinton's past support for border security measures, including voting for the Secure Fence Act, but also her later reservations about a wall, the statement is partially accurate but omits important details or takes things out of context.

The statement ""We already have won"" the election was made on November 4, 2020. This date is crucial because it was the day after the 2020 United States presidential election, which took place on November 3, 2020.

## Step 2: Determine the status of the election results on the statement's date
On November 4, 2020, the outcome of the presidential election was not yet officially determined. Votes were still being counted in several key states, and no major news networks had projected a winner. The process of counting votes, especially mail-in ballots, was ongoing.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement against the facts
Given that the election results were not finalized and no official winner had been declared by the time the statement was made, claiming ""We already have won"" the election would be inaccurate. The outcome of the election was still uncertain, with several states' results pending.

## Step 4: Consider credible sources
Major news outlets and election officials had not declared a winner as of November 4, 2020. The Associated Press, CNN, Fox News, and other reputable sources were still reporting on the ongoing vote count and had not projected a winner.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the criteria

The statement claims that Goodyear Tires announced a ban on ""MAGA hats"" and attributes this action to the influence of ""Radical Left Democrats.""

## Step 2: Research the incident
On August 19, 2020, it was reported that Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company faced backlash after a presentation at a Topeka, Kansas, plant allegedly showed a slide that categorized ""MAGA attire"" as unacceptable under the company's zero-tolerance policy for workplace discrimination and harassment. However, the company later clarified that the slide was not approved by its corporate office and that it does allow employees to express their political views in the workplace, as long as they do not disrupt the work environment or violate company policies.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
The statement that Goodyear Tires ""announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS"" is misleading. While there was an incident involving a presentation slide that suggested ""MAGA attire"" could be considered unacceptable, this was not a company-wide policy announcement. Goodyear clarified that it does not ban MAGA hats or any political attire, as long as it does not disrupt the workplace.

## Step 4: Consider the context and the role of ""Radical Left Democrats""
There is no evidence to suggest that the incident was directly influenced by ""Radical Left Democrats"" as claimed in the statement. The controversy arose from an internal presentation at a single plant, and the company's subsequent clarification indicated that the slide did not reflect its official policy.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Given the information and the clarification provided by Goodyear, the statement is not accurate. It misrepresents the company's policy and attributes the incident to an unfounded cause. Therefore, the statement should be labeled as ""false"" because it does not accurately reflect the facts and introduces misleading information.

The statement claims that John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA, which is described as ""disgraceful."" The key elements here are John Podesta, the DNC server, the FBI, and the CIA.

## Step 2: Verify the facts surrounding the DNC server and investigations
In 2016, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was hacked, leading to the release of sensitive information. The FBI investigated this cyberattack. It's known that the DNC did not provide the FBI with direct access to their servers but instead allowed a third-party cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, to investigate and share findings with the FBI.

## Step 3: Determine John Podesta's role and actions
John Podesta was the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. His personal email account was also hacked during the campaign season, but the statement specifically mentions the DNC server, not his personal account.

## Step 4: Assess the involvement of the CIA
The CIA's role in investigating the hacking of the DNC server is less direct than the FBI's. The CIA is involved in foreign intelligence, and while they would have an interest in the hacking due to its implications for national security, the primary investigation was led by the FBI.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given that the DNC allowed a third-party firm to investigate and share findings with the FBI, rather than directly handing over their servers, the statement that John Podesta ""refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA"" simplifies the situation. The DNC's decision not to provide direct access to their servers was likely due to concerns about privacy and the integrity of their systems, rather than a refusal to cooperate with the investigation.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"Says his job approval poll numbers are ""not bad"" relative to other presidents at this point in his presidency.",7/16/2017,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/jul/17/donald-trump/trumps-false-claim-his-presidential-approval-ratin/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Identify the context of the statement
The statement is about a president's job approval poll numbers being ""not bad"" relative to other presidents at the same point in their presidency. The date of the statement is July 16, 2017.

## Step 2: Determine the president in question
Given the date of the statement (July 16, 2017), the president in question would be Donald Trump, as he was the President of the United States at that time.

## Step 3: Research historical job approval ratings
To assess the accuracy of the statement, we need to look at historical job approval ratings of U.S. presidents around the same point in their presidencies. This involves comparing Trump's approval ratings with those of his predecessors at a similar stage.

## Step 4: Find Trump's approval rating around July 2017
According to Gallup polls, which are a reliable source for presidential approval ratings, Donald Trump's job approval rating around July 2017 was approximately 40%. This is based on Gallup's daily tracking polls.

## Step 5: Compare with historical data
Historically, presidents have had varying levels of approval at this stage. For example, Barack Obama had an approval rating of about 53% at a similar point in his presidency, while George W. Bush had an approval rating of around 59%. However, it's also important to note that approval ratings can fluctuate significantly over time and can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, foreign policy events, and domestic issues.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement
Given that Trump's approval rating was lower than many of his predecessors at a similar point, the statement that his job approval poll numbers are ""not bad"" relative to other presidents could be seen as misleading or lacking context. While it's true that some presidents have had lower ratings, the comparison depends on which presidents are being considered and the specific circumstances of their presidencies.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Considering the information available and the context provided, the statement seems to downplay the significance of Trump's relatively low approval ratings compared to many of his predecessors. Therefore, the statement could be considered ""mostly false"" because it contains an element of truth (approval ratings can vary widely among presidents) but ignores critical facts (Trump's ratings were lower than many predecessors) that would give a different impression.

pants-fire,Donald Trump,"""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever.""",9/20/2016,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/sep/22/donald-trump/trumps-pants-fire-claim-blacks-are-absolutely-wors/,error,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that African-American communities are in the worst shape they have ever been in before, as of the date given (9/20/2016). This is a broad claim that encompasses various aspects of community life, including economic, social, educational, and health conditions.

## Step 2: Historical Context
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, it's essential to consider historical data on African-American communities. Historically, African-American communities have faced significant challenges, including slavery, segregation, discrimination, and systemic racism, which have impacted their economic, educational, and health outcomes.

## Step 3: Economic Conditions
As of 2016, while there were still significant disparities, some economic indicators for African-Americans had improved compared to historical lows. For example, the unemployment rate for African-Americans, though higher than for whites, had decreased from its peak during the Great Recession. However, the wealth gap and income inequality persisted.

## Step 4: Social and Educational Conditions
In education, there were improvements in high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates for African-Americans. However, disparities in educational outcomes and access to quality education remained. Socially, issues like mass incarceration, police brutality, and systemic racism continued to affect African-American communities disproportionately.

## Step 5: Health Conditions
Health disparities also persisted, with African-Americans experiencing higher rates of certain diseases and lower life expectancy compared to their white counterparts. However, access to healthcare had improved with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was enacted in 2010.

## Step 6: Comparison to Historical Conditions
Considering the historical context, it's crucial to compare the conditions in 2016 to those during periods of slavery, the Jim Crow era, and the Civil Rights Movement, when legal segregation and overt discrimination were prevalent. These periods were marked by extreme violence, legal discrimination, and severe economic and social oppression.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Given the complexities and the broad nature of the statement, it's challenging to definitively label it as entirely true or false without considering the specific metrics or aspects of community life being referenced. However, when comparing the overall state of African-American communities in 2016 to historical periods of legal slavery, segregation, and overt discrimination, it can be argued that the statement overlooks significant progress made in civil rights, education, and economic opportunities, even as it acknowledges the persistence of disparities.

The claim is that Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on the middle class, as stated on 8/4/2016.

## Step 2: Research Hillary Clinton's tax plan in 2016
According to various sources, including her official campaign website and fact-checking organizations, Hillary Clinton's tax plan during her 2016 presidential campaign focused on increasing taxes on the wealthy, not the middle class. She proposed measures such as the ""Buffett Rule,"" which would have ensured that millionaires pay at least a 30% tax rate, and closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim against Clinton's tax plan
Given Clinton's proposals, the statement that she wants to raise taxes on the middle class does not align with her campaign's tax plan, which aimed to increase taxes on the wealthy while providing tax relief or maintaining current tax rates for the middle class.

## Step 4: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on 8/4/2016, during the presidential campaign. At that time, Clinton's tax plan was publicly available and emphasized taxing the wealthy, not the middle class.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Based on Clinton's tax plan and proposals during her 2016 campaign, the statement that she wants to raise taxes on the middle class is not supported by factual evidence. It contradicts her publicly stated policies, which focused on taxing the wealthy.

The key claim is that ""The murder rate in our country is the highest its been in 47 years"" as of the date of the statement, which is 2/7/2017.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data source for murder rates
To verify the claim, we need to look at historical murder rate data from a credible source. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program is a primary source for crime data in the United States.

## Step 3: Review historical murder rate data
According to the FBI's UCR data, the murder rate in the United States has fluctuated over the years. To assess the claim, we need to compare the murder rate for the year preceding the statement (2016) with historical data going back 47 years (to 1970).

## Step 4: Analyze the data for the specific year and historical context
The FBI's data shows that the murder rate in the United States was indeed higher in the late 1980s and early 1990s than in the years immediately preceding 2017. However, the claim is about the rate being the highest in 47 years as of 2017.

## Step 5: Evaluate the claim against the data
As of 2017, the murder rate had seen an increase from 2015 to 2016, but it was not the highest it had been in 47 years. The peak murder rates were observed in the early 1990s. The claim seems to be misleading based on the general trend of decreasing murder rates from the 1990s peak until around 2015, followed by a slight increase.

## Step 6: Consider the context and any necessary clarifications
The statement lacks context regarding the overall trend of murder rates over the past 47 years and the specific rates for the years immediately preceding 2017. It implies a continuous increase or a significant spike that is not supported by the data.

## Step 7: Conclude based on the analysis

FALSE,Donald Trump,"""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.""",11/10/2018,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/nov/12/donald-trump/trumps-overly-simplistic-and-false-claim-californi/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that the primary reason for the massive, deadly, and costly forest fires in California is poor forest management. This implies that if forest management were better, these fires could be prevented or significantly reduced in severity.

## Step 2: Evaluating Forest Management's Role
Forest management does play a role in preventing and mitigating forest fires. Proper management can include thinning forests, creating firebreaks, and conducting controlled burns to reduce fuel loads. However, the complexity of forest fires involves many factors beyond just management, including climate change, drought, human activity (such as arson or accidental ignition from human sources), and natural causes like lightning.

## Step 3: Considering Climate Change and Drought
Climate change has been linked to an increase in extreme weather conditions, including droughts and heatwaves, which are significant factors in the spread and severity of wildfires. California has experienced severe droughts and heatwaves, which dry out vegetation and create conditions ripe for wildfires.

## Step 4: Reviewing Expert Opinions and Studies
Experts and studies have pointed out that while forest management is important, it is not the sole or even primary cause of the severity of wildfires in California. For example, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that human-caused climate change has been a major factor in the increase of wildfires in the western United States.

## Step 5: Assessing the Role of Human Activity
Human activity, both in terms of ignition sources (such as arson, discarded cigarettes, or sparks from machinery) and the expansion of human settlements into wildland-urban interfaces, also plays a critical role in the occurrence and severity of wildfires.

## Step 6: Conclusion Based on Available Information
Given the multifactorial nature of wildfires, including climate change, drought, human activity, and natural causes, alongside forest management, the statement oversimplifies the issue. It ignores critical factors that contribute to the severity and occurrence of wildfires in California, making it misleading.

mostly-false,Donald Trump,"""The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly.""",4/26/2017,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/apr/27/donald-trump/did-trade-deficit-cause-slow-growth-2016-donald-tr/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the key components of the statement
The statement claims that the U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years in 2016, with a GDP growth of only 1.6%, and attributes this to trade deficits hurting the economy.

## Step 2: Verify the GDP growth rate for 2016
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the real GDP growth rate for 2016 was indeed 1.6%. This confirms the GDP growth rate mentioned in the statement.

## Step 3: Determine if it was the slowest economic growth in five years
To verify if 2016 had the slowest economic growth in five years, we need to compare the GDP growth rates of the preceding years. The BEA reports the following real GDP growth rates for the years 2012 through 2015: 2.2% for 2012, 1.7% for 2013, 2.4% for 2014, and 2.1% for 2015. Since 1.6% is lower than the growth rates of the preceding years, 2016 indeed had the slowest economic growth in five years.

## Step 4: Assess the impact of trade deficits on the economy
The statement claims that trade deficits hurt the economy very badly. While trade deficits can have negative effects on the economy, such as reducing domestic employment in certain sectors, the overall impact of trade deficits on the economy is complex and can vary. The claim that trade deficits ""hurt the economy very badly"" might be an oversimplification.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on the criteria
Given that the GDP growth rate for 2016 and its comparison to previous years are accurate, but the statement simplifies the impact of trade deficits, we need to consider if the statement is true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, or implausible.

half-true,Donald Trump,"Says President Dwight Eisenhower ""moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country.""",11/10/2015,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/nov/11/donald-trump/trump-eisenhower-deported-15-million-immigrants/,mostly true,"*
I label this statement as: mostly true.

The statement that President Dwight Eisenhower ""moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country"" refers to an event known as ""Operation Wetback,"" which took place in 1954. This operation was a U.S. government initiative aimed at deporting undocumented immigrants, primarily of Mexican descent, from the southwestern United States back to Mexico.

According to historical records and credible sources, including the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and various academic studies, Operation Wetback did indeed result in the deportation of a significant number of undocumented immigrants. Estimates of the number deported vary, but the figure of around 1 million is commonly cited, with some sources suggesting it could have been higher.

While the exact number of 1.5 million might be subject to some debate due to variations in historical accounts and the challenges of accurately documenting such events, the essence of the statement—that President Eisenhower oversaw a large-scale deportation effort of illegal immigrants—is supported by historical evidence.

Therefore, considering the context and the available historical data, the statement can be labeled as ""mostly true"" because it accurately reflects the occurrence of a significant deportation event under Eisenhower's presidency, even if the precise number might be somewhat disputed.

The statement claims that Joe Biden said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, but then a picture emerged showing him playing golf with the company boss and Hunter Biden.

## Step 2: Verify the claim about Joe Biden's statement
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we first need to verify if Joe Biden indeed claimed he never spoke to the Ukrainian company. This requires checking credible news sources and fact-checking websites from around the time the statement was made (October 2019).

## Step 3: Investigate the existence of the picture
Next, we need to investigate if there is any evidence of a picture showing Joe Biden playing golf with the Ukrainian company boss and Hunter Biden. This involves searching for news articles, official statements, and fact-checking reports from reputable sources.

## Step 4: Evaluate the context and timing
Considering the date of the statement (October 6, 2019), we must evaluate the political and news context at that time, especially regarding the Biden family's involvement with Ukraine. This includes the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump and allegations surrounding Joe Biden and his son Hunter's activities in Ukraine.

## Step 5: Consult credible sources
Credible sources such as fact-checking organizations (e.g., FactCheck.org, PolitiFact), major news outlets (e.g., The New York Times, BBC), and official statements from Joe Biden or his representatives should be consulted to verify the accuracy of the claim.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Based on the information gathered, we can determine if the statement is true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, or implausible. This involves considering if Joe Biden made the claimed statement, if the picture exists and its context, and any other relevant facts that could affect the statement's accuracy.

The statement claims that 122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield.

## Step 2: Determine the source of the data
To verify the claim, we need to look at data from credible sources such as the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) or other government reports that track the recidivism of Guantanamo Bay detainees.

## Step 3: Review available data up to the statement's date (3/7/2017)
As of the latest report available before the statement's date, the ODNI reported on the recidivism of Guantanamo detainees. According to the ODNI's report from July 2016, out of 676 detainees transferred out of Guantanamo Bay, 122 were confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorist activities, and another 86 were suspected to have done so.

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the statement
Given the information from the ODNI report, the statement that ""122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield"" aligns with the number of confirmed recidivists as of the last report before the statement's date. However, it does not account for those suspected of re-engaging, which could imply a higher total, nor does it specify the time frame of release, which could include releases under previous administrations as well.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential for missing information
The statement specifically mentions the Obama Administration, which could be misleading if some of those 122 were released under previous administrations. However, the majority of releases did occur under Obama. The term ""vicious prisoners"" is subjective and not a term used in official reports, which might add an emotional tone to the statement.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given the information available and the context, the statement is mostly accurate in terms of the number of confirmed recidivists but lacks specificity regarding the time frame of release and the administrations involved. It also uses emotive language not found in factual reports.

The statement claims that Senator Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Iran Deal, even disagreeing with President Obama, and then voted against it. However, it also states that Schumer now says the speaker should not have terminated the deal.

## Step 2: Verify Schumer's stance on the Iran Deal
According to various news sources, including The New York Times and CNN, Senator Chuck Schumer did express reservations about the Iran Deal. However, his final stance and actions need to be verified for accuracy.

## Step 3: Check Schumer's vote on the Iran Deal
Senator Schumer did vote against the Iran Deal in 2015. This is a matter of public record and can be verified through official Senate voting records and news reports from the time.

## Step 4: Assess Schumer's comments on the termination of the deal
After the deal was terminated, Schumer criticized the decision, suggesting that it was a mistake to withdraw from the agreement without a clear plan for what comes next. This criticism aligns with his role as a political opponent and his previous reservations about the deal's enforcement and verification mechanisms.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement for accuracy and context
Given the verified information, Schumer did indeed vote against the Iran Deal and had expressed concerns about it. However, the statement simplifies his position and the context of his criticisms both before and after the deal's termination. It implies a contradiction in his stance that may not fully reflect his nuanced views on the deal and its termination.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement contains elements of truth but lacks nuance and context, particularly in how it portrays Schumer's current stance on the deal's termination. It simplifies complex political positions and ignores the evolution of Schumer's comments over time.

The statement claims that Deborah Birx traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving, her family called the police and turned her in, and then she resigned.

## Step 2: Verify Deborah Birx's actions during Thanksgiving
According to news reports from November 2020, Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator at the time, did travel out of state to visit her family for Thanksgiving, despite her own advice to Americans to avoid travel and gatherings during the holiday season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Step 3: Check if her family called the police and turned her in
There is no credible evidence or news report suggesting that Deborah Birx's family called the police and turned her in for visiting them during Thanksgiving.

## Step 4: Confirm if Deborah Birx resigned after the incident
Deborah Birx did announce her intention to retire from her position after the presidential transition in January 2021, but there is no direct link between her Thanksgiving travel and her resignation decision as described in the statement.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the information, the statement contains some truth about Deborah Birx traveling for Thanksgiving, which was controversial. However, it inaccurately claims her family turned her in to the police and directly links this incident to her resignation, which are not supported by facts.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on its accuracy
Considering the statement has an element of truth (Birx's travel) but ignores critical facts (no police involvement, and the resignation context is misleading), it should be labeled as ""mostly false"" because it contains a mix of truth and significant inaccuracies that alter the impression of the events.

The statement claims that Hillary Clinton ""gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia."" This involves understanding the context of uranium supply, Hillary Clinton's role, and any transactions involving Russia.

## Step 2: Understand the context of uranium supply and transactions
The United States has various regulations and agencies involved in the management and sale of uranium, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department of Energy. Any significant transaction, especially one involving a foreign country like Russia, would be subject to scrutiny and approval by these bodies.

## Step 3: Investigate Hillary Clinton's role in uranium transactions
During her tenure as Secretary of State (2009-2013), Hillary Clinton was part of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments in U.S. companies for national security implications. One notable transaction was the sale of Uranium One, a company with uranium mining operations in the United States, to Rosatom, a Russian state-owned nuclear company.

## Step 4: Examine the specifics of the Uranium One deal
The Uranium One deal allowed Rosatom to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, which indeed had mining operations in the United States. However, the claim that this transaction resulted in Russia gaining control of 20% of America's uranium supply needs verification. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the uranium mined by Uranium One's U.S. operations could not be exported without a license, and the company was subject to U.S. regulations.

## Step 5: Evaluate the claim based on factual evidence
The claim that Hillary Clinton ""gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia"" simplifies a complex transaction and overstates the direct role of Clinton in the decision-making process. While Clinton was on the CFIUS, the committee's approval of the Uranium One sale did not directly equate to her personally ""giving up"" uranium supplies. Moreover, the actual control and export of uranium were subject to U.S. regulatory oversight.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement

The statement claims that no car plants had been built in the United States for decades, but now many are being built.

## Step 2: Research car plant construction in the United States
According to various sources, including news articles and industry reports, there have been instances of new car plant constructions or significant expansions in the United States in the years leading up to 2019. For example, in 2017, Toyota and Mazda announced a plan to build a new assembly plant in the United States, and in 2018, Volkswagen announced an expansion of its plant in Tennessee.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim of no car plants being built for decades
While it is true that the rate of new car plant construction in the United States had slowed down significantly since the 1980s, it is not entirely accurate to say that no car plants had been built in decades. There were instances of new plant constructions or significant expansions, such as the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, which was reopened in 2010 after being closed by General Motors and Toyota.

## Step 4: Assess the current situation as of 2019
As of 2019, there were indeed announcements and plans for new car plant constructions or expansions in the United States, such as the aforementioned Toyota-Mazda plant and Volkswagen's expansion. However, the statement's implication that many plants were being built ""all throughout the United States"" might be an exaggeration.

The statement claims that due to the health care act, people who currently have health care and are satisfied with it will not be able to keep their current health care plans.

## Step 2: Context of the Health Care Act
The health care act being referred to is likely the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was passed in 2010. A key aspect of the ACA was the requirement for health insurance plans to meet certain minimum standards, which could potentially affect existing plans.

## Step 3: Impact on Existing Health Care Plans
According to the ACA, health insurance plans that were in existence before the law was passed (grandfathered plans) were allowed to continue, but they had to comply with certain provisions of the law. However, if these plans made significant changes, they would lose their grandfathered status and have to meet the full requirements of the ACA.

## Step 4: Evaluating the Statement
The statement suggests that people who have health care and like it will not be able to keep what they have. While it is true that some plans might have to change to comply with the ACA, the law did allow for the continuation of existing plans under certain conditions. The key issue is whether the changes required by the ACA would force people out of their current plans.

## Step 5: Conclusion Based on Facts
Given the information and the context of the ACA, the statement that people who have health care and like it are not going to be able to keep what they have is not entirely accurate without additional context. The ACA did allow for the continuation of existing plans if they did not make significant changes, but it also introduced requirements that could affect these plans.

The statement claims that Social Security was advocated in the 1930s as a means to encourage people to stop working due to a perceived permanent scarcity of jobs in the United States.

## Step 2: Historical Context of Social Security
Social Security was introduced in the United States as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, specifically through the Social Security Act of 1935. The primary goal was to provide financial assistance to the elderly, the disabled, and the unemployed, aiming to alleviate the widespread poverty and economic hardship caused by the Great Depression.

## Step 3: Purpose of Social Security
The main purpose of Social Security was not to get people to quit working but to provide a safety net for those who were no longer able to work due to age or disability and to support those who were unemployed. It was designed to address the economic insecurity faced by many Americans during the Great Depression.

## Step 4: Addressing the Claim of Permanent Scarcity of Jobs
While the Great Depression did indeed lead to a significant scarcity of jobs, the idea of Social Security was not based on the premise that this scarcity was permanent. Instead, it was a response to the immediate economic crisis and a way to ensure that vulnerable populations were protected.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement
Given the historical context and the actual purposes of Social Security, the statement appears to misrepresent the reasons behind the advocacy for Social Security in the 1930s. It inaccurately suggests that the program was promoted as a way to get people to quit working due to a perceived permanent job scarcity, which does not align with the program's actual goals and the historical context.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the statement is not accurate. It misrepresents the historical context and the purposes of Social Security. Therefore, it should be labeled as ""false"" because it does not accurately reflect the reasons why Social Security was advocated for in the 1930s.

The statement given is ""Forty-five percent of doctors 'say they'll quit' if health care reform passes,"" and it was recorded on 10/12/2009.

## Step 2: Research the context of the statement
In 2009, the United States was in the midst of a significant healthcare reform debate, which would eventually lead to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, in March 2010. The statement likely refers to the potential impact of this reform on the medical profession.

## Step 3: Look for surveys or studies from that time
To verify the statement, we need to find surveys or studies conducted around the time of the statement (October 2009) that asked doctors about their intentions regarding their practice if healthcare reform were to pass.

## Step 4: Evaluate the findings of relevant surveys
One notable survey from that period is the ""MedPage Today"" survey, but more prominently, a survey by the Investors Business Daily (IBD) in 2009 reported that 45% of doctors said they would consider quitting if the healthcare reform passed. However, this survey and its methodology have been criticized for potential biases and for not being representative of all doctors.

## Step 5: Consider the credibility and potential biases of sources
It's essential to consider the credibility and potential biases of the sources reporting the survey results. The IBD survey, for example, was criticized by some for its methodology and the potential for biased sampling.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available, the statement seems to be based on a real survey, but its accuracy and the survey's methodology have been questioned. The survey does indicate that a significant percentage of doctors expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed healthcare reform, but the exact figure and its implications are subject to interpretation.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the criteria

The confrontation began when Manney approached Hamilton, who was sleeping on a park bench. Manney reportedly attempted to pat down Hamilton, which led to a physical altercation. During the altercation, Manney shot Hamilton 14 times.

While the statement that Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee"" captures the location and the number of shots, it simplifies the circumstances leading to the shooting.

The key claim is that scientists are saying to leave nuclear waste where it is, implying a solution to the problem of nuclear waste management.

## Step 2: Consider the context of nuclear waste management as of 2010
As of 2010, the management of nuclear waste was a significant concern globally, with various methods being considered, including storage, disposal, and reprocessing. The idea of simply leaving nuclear waste where it is would be a significant departure from standard practices and recommendations by scientific communities and regulatory bodies.

## Step 3: Evaluate the general stance of the scientific community on nuclear waste
The scientific community generally advocates for careful management and disposal of nuclear waste to prevent environmental contamination and health risks. Leaving nuclear waste in place without proper containment or disposal methods would not align with the consensus on safe and responsible nuclear waste management.

## Step 4: Assess the statement for accuracy and context
Given the general consensus and practices around nuclear waste management, the statement seems to oversimplify or misrepresent the scientific community's stance. There is no widespread agreement to simply leave nuclear waste where it is, as this would not address the long-term safety and environmental concerns associated with nuclear waste.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement does not accurately reflect the scientific consensus or recommended practices for nuclear waste management as of 2010 or in general. It ignores critical facts about the need for safe and responsible management of nuclear waste.

The statement claims that between 27,000 and 200,000 Wisconsinites were turned away from the polls in 2016 due to a lack of proper identification. This is a specific claim about voter turnout and voter ID laws in Wisconsin during the 2016 election.

## Step 2: Researching Voter ID Laws in Wisconsin
Wisconsin has had a voter ID law in place since 2011, which requires voters to present a valid form of photo identification to cast a ballot. This law has been the subject of controversy and legal challenges, with opponents arguing it disenfranchises certain groups, such as low-income individuals, minorities, and the elderly, who may not have the required identification.

## Step 3: Examining the Impact of Voter ID Laws
Studies and reports have shown that voter ID laws can indeed reduce voter turnout, particularly among groups that are less likely to possess the required identification. However, quantifying the exact number of individuals turned away due to lack of ID can be challenging, as election officials may not always track this data comprehensively.

## Step 4: Evaluating the Specific Claim
The claim of 27,000 to 200,000 Wisconsinites being turned away is quite broad. To assess its accuracy, we need to look for studies, reports, or data from reputable sources that estimate the number of voters affected by the voter ID law in Wisconsin during the 2016 election.

## Step 5: Reviewing Available Data and Studies
A study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 found that an estimated 16,800 to 23,250 eligible voters in Wisconsin's two largest counties did not vote in the 2016 presidential election due to the state's voter ID law. While this study does not cover the entire state, it provides insight into the potential impact of the law.

## Step 6: Considering the Date of the Statement
The statement was made on September 17, 2019. At this point, there would have been time for some analysis and studies on the 2016 election to have been conducted and published, potentially supporting or refuting the claim.

The statement claims that between 40,000 and 80,000 people in Wisconsin were turned away from the polls in 2016 due to the color of their skin and other factors, attributing this to a key provision of the Voting Rights Act not being in effect.

## Step 2: Context of the Voting Rights Act
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark legislation that outlawed discriminatory voting practices. A key provision, Section 4(b), which determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance under Section 5, was struck down by the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder (2013). This decision effectively halted the preclearance requirement, which had been in place to prevent discriminatory changes to voting laws in certain states and localities.

## Step 3: Impact on Wisconsin
Wisconsin was not one of the states covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act that required preclearance for changes to its voting laws. However, the state did implement voter ID laws, which some argue disproportionately affect minority voters.

## Step 4: Voter ID Laws in Wisconsin
Wisconsin's voter ID law, enacted in 2011, requires voters to present a valid form of photo identification at the polls. Critics argue that such laws can disenfranchise certain groups, including minorities and low-income individuals, who may be less likely to possess the required ID.

## Step 5: Analysis of Voter Turnaway
Studies and reports have shown that voter ID laws can lead to voter disenfranchisement. A study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017 found that an estimated 16,800 to 23,250 eligible voters in Wisconsin's two largest counties did not vote in the 2016 presidential election due to the state's voter ID law. However, this does not directly confirm the statement's claim of 40,000 to 80,000 people being turned away due to the color of their skin.

While there is evidence that voter ID laws can disproportionately affect certain groups, including minorities, and that thousands of eligible voters in Wisconsin may have been deterred from voting due to the ID requirement, the specific claim of 40,000 to 80,000 people being turned away because of the color of their skin and other factors, directly attributed to the Voting Rights Act provision not being in effect, lacks direct, concrete evidence to","## Step 1: Understanding the Statement

The statement claims that as of May 5, 2015, not a single Republican candidate, whether announced or potential, was clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship.

## Step 2: Consider the context and timing of the statement
Given the date of the statement (May 5, 2015), we need to look at the positions of Republican candidates for the presidency around that time, especially focusing on their stances on immigration and paths to citizenship.

## Step 3: Research the positions of Republican candidates in 2015
In 2015, several Republican candidates had announced their intention to run for the presidency, including Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump, among others. The positions of these candidates on immigration varied, but it's crucial to identify if any of them supported a path to citizenship.

## Step 4: Evaluate the positions of key candidates
- Jeb Bush had expressed support for a path to citizenship in the past, but his position evolved over time.
- Marco Rubio, as part of the Gang of Eight in 2013, had supported a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to citizenship, but by 2015, his stance had shifted, and he was more focused on border security.
- Ted Cruz and Donald Trump were more opposed to a path to citizenship, advocating for stricter immigration policies.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Considering the evolving positions of Republican candidates, it's essential to verify if any of them, as of May 5, 2015, clearly and consistently supported a path to citizenship. Given the shifts in positions and the lack of a clear, consistent supporter among the major candidates, the statement appears to have a basis in fact.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Based on the information available and considering the context of the time, the statement that ""Not a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one."" seems to be accurate as of May 5, 2015. However, it's also important to note that positions on immigration were complex and evolving, which might suggest a need for clarification. Nonetheless, given the criteria provided, the statement aligns most closely with being true, as there was no prominent Republican candidate at that time who was both announced and consistently supporting a path to citizenship.

According to the World Bank, Afghanistan's GDP growth rate was indeed improving around the time the statement was made, with a growth rate of 3.9% in 2012 and 3.6% in 2013, indicating an upward trend in economic growth.

## Step 2: Assess the claim about opium production in Afghanistan
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported that opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan did decrease in 2010 but then increased in subsequent years. By 2013, opium poppy cultivation had risen, suggesting that the claim of opium production being down might not be entirely accurate for the period in question.

## Step 3: Examine the statement about infant mortality in Afghanistan
Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other sources indicate that infant mortality rates in Afghanistan did decline over the years leading up to 2014. This improvement can be attributed to various health initiatives and improvements in healthcare access.

## Step 4: Investigate the claim about school enrollment in Afghanistan
Reports from UNESCO and other educational organizations suggest that school enrollment, especially for girls, saw significant increases in Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban in 2001. However, the exact sevenfold increase might be difficult to verify without more specific data on the time frame considered.

## Step 5: Consider the overall accuracy of the statement
Given the mixed findings, with some claims being supported (economic growth and decline in infant mortality) and others being less clear or not entirely accurate (opium production and the specific increase in school enrollment), the statement cannot be labeled as entirely true but does contain elements of truth.

The statement is about a healthcare plan and its cost, specifically mentioning that it will cost $110-billion in the first year and suggesting that this can be paid for with savings.

## Step 2: Determine the speaker and the plan
Given the date (9/17/2007) and the context, it's likely the statement refers to a presidential candidate's healthcare plan during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. A key candidate at that time with a notable healthcare plan was Hillary Clinton.

## Step 3: Research Hillary Clinton's healthcare plan from 2007
According to various sources, including news articles and fact-checking websites from that time, Hillary Clinton did propose a healthcare plan during her 2008 presidential campaign. The plan aimed to provide universal healthcare coverage.

## Step 4: Verify the cost of the plan
The cost of Clinton's healthcare plan was a subject of debate. While the exact figure of $110-billion for the first year is mentioned in the statement, fact-checking organizations and news outlets at the time discussed various estimates and critiques of the plan's cost and how it would be funded.

## Step 5: Evaluate the funding mechanism
Clinton's plan proposed to pay for the healthcare expansion through a combination of mechanisms, including rolling back tax cuts for the wealthy, reducing administrative costs, and other savings. The statement simplifies this by saying it ""can be paid for with savings,"" which might not fully capture the complexity of the proposed funding mechanisms.

## Step 6: Assess the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available, the statement about the cost and the funding mechanism simplifies the complexities of the healthcare plan and its financial projections. While it's based on some factual elements, it lacks detail and might misrepresent the overall funding strategy.

## Step 7: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the statement's simplification and potential for misunderstanding the funding mechanisms, it's not entirely accurate but does contain elements of truth. Therefore, it's not ""true"" or ""mostly true"" due to the lack of detail and potential for misinterpretation. It's also not ""false"" because it does reference a real proposal.

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) was signed by the United States and Russia on April 8, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011. It aims to limit the number of strategic nuclear missiles, bombers, and launchers that can be deployed by each country.

## Step 2: Clinton's Role and the Treaty's Provisions
During Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State (2009-2013), the New START treaty was indeed passed. The treaty requires both the U.S. and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals. Specifically, it limits each country to 1,550 deployed warheads, 800 deployed and non-deployed launchers, and 700 deployed launchers.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Statement
The statement claims that New START is a ""treaty cutting Russia's nuclear arms."" Given the information about the treaty's provisions, it is clear that New START does indeed aim to reduce the number of nuclear arms of both the United States and Russia, including Russia's.

## Step 4: Conclusion
Considering the facts about the New START treaty and its goals, the statement is accurate in describing the treaty's effect on Russia's nuclear arms. However, it might be seen as slightly simplistic since the treaty reduces nuclear arms for both the U.S. and Russia, not just Russia.

The statement claims that Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation and are dead last in funding per student, as of the given date (3/15/2016).

## Step 2: Verify the ranking of Arizona schools
According to the data available up to 2016, Arizona's education ranking has been a subject of various reports. A report by Education Week in 2016 ranked Arizona 45th in the nation in terms of overall education performance, which aligns with the first part of the statement.

## Step 3: Verify the funding per student
Regarding funding per student, data from the National Education Association (NEA) and other sources have consistently shown that Arizona ranks among the lowest states in the U.S. in terms of per-pupil spending. As of 2016, Arizona was indeed among the bottom states in funding per student, with some reports indicating it was the lowest.

## Step 4: Consider the date of the statement
Given that the statement was made on 3/15/2016, the information available up to that point supports both claims made in the statement. The ranking and funding data from reputable sources like Education Week and the NEA for the years leading up to 2016 substantiate the statement's claims.

The statement claims that Bernie Sanders was against the auto bailout and voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.

## Step 2: Research Bernie Sanders' stance on the auto bailout
According to various sources, including PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, Bernie Sanders did vote against the auto bailout in 2008. However, it's essential to understand the context of his vote.

## Step 3: Understand the context of Bernie Sanders' vote
Sanders voted against the bailout because it was part of a larger $700 billion bailout package for the financial industry, which he opposed. He has stated that he supported assistance for the auto industry but not as part of a broader bailout for Wall Street.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the context, the statement that Bernie Sanders ""was against the auto bailout"" and ""voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry"" is partially accurate but omits important details. Sanders did vote against the initial bailout package, but his opposition was primarily due to the inclusion of Wall Street bailouts, not necessarily the auto industry component.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the information and the need for clarification regarding Sanders' reasons for voting against the bailout, the statement should be labeled as ""half true"" because it is partially accurate but omits critical context that would give a different impression.

The statement claims that the campaign in question relies on small donations for the majority of its support. This implies that a significant portion of the campaign's funding comes from numerous small donations rather than a few large ones.

## Step 2: Contextualizing the Date
Given the date of the statement (3/15/2016), it's essential to consider the context of political campaigns during that time, especially in the United States, where such statements are commonly made. The 2016 U.S. presidential election was ongoing, with various candidates emphasizing their reliance on small donors to contrast themselves with opponents perceived as being backed by large donors or special interest groups.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Claim
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to look at data on campaign finance, specifically the sources of funding for political campaigns around that time. According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and other campaign finance watchdog groups, some candidates in the 2016 election did indeed receive a significant portion of their funding from small donors. For example, the campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump were noted for their reliance on small donations, although the extent and implications of this varied.

## Step 4: Considering the Implications
The statement's accuracy can depend on how one defines ""small donations"" and ""majority of our support."" If by ""small donations"" the campaign means contributions under $200 (a common threshold used by the FEC to define small donors), and if these donations constitute more than 50% of the campaign's total funding, then the statement could be considered true. However, without specific data or a clear definition of these terms, the statement lacks clarity.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Given the information available and the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the statement could be seen as having some basis in fact, especially if referring to specific campaigns known for their small-donor support. However, without more specific details about the campaign in question and its financials, the statement is somewhat vague.

The statement claims that as of the date given (7/20/2020), President Donald Trump had not made any comments as the President of the United States regarding bounties on American troops.

## Step 2: Consider the context of the statement
The context involves reports of bounties placed on American troops by foreign entities, which was a significant news story around the time of the statement. The New York Times reported on June 26, 2020, that Russia had offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan, including Americans.

## Step 3: Determine President Trump's response to the bounty reports
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to verify if President Trump had indeed not commented on the bounties as of July 20, 2020. President Trump's responses and comments on significant issues are well-documented by news outlets and official White House communications.

## Step 4: Evaluate available information and credible sources
As of the specified date, there were reports and criticisms that President Trump had not adequately addressed the issue of Russian bounties on American troops. The President and the White House had made statements downplaying the significance of the intelligence regarding the bounties and questioning its validity.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on available evidence

The statement claims that Vermont is the state with the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to look at data related to gun crime origins in New York, specifically focusing on the source states of these guns. The date of the statement is 4/11/2016, so we should consider data available up to that point.

## Step 3: Examine relevant data and reports
According to reports and data from around that time, such as those from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives), guns used in crimes in New York often come from other states with less stringent gun laws. Vermont has been noted in various studies for having relatively lax gun laws compared to New York.

## Step 4: Evaluate the specific claim about Vermont
While Vermont does have less restrictive gun laws, which could potentially contribute to a higher rate of guns being trafficked to New York, the statement's claim about per capita rates needs to be scrutinized. Per capita rates account for the population size of the states, which is crucial for understanding the proportionate contribution of each state to gun crimes in New York.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
Without specific data on the per capita rates of guns from Vermont (and other states) used in crimes in New York as of 2016, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as true or false. However, given the context of gun laws and trafficking patterns, it's plausible that Vermont could be a significant source of guns used in New York crimes, but the per capita aspect requires precise data for confirmation.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on available information
Given the lack of specific per capita data in the statement and the complexity of accurately attributing the source of crime guns, the statement might be considered partially accurate but lacking in detail necessary for full verification.

To assess the truthfulness of this claim, let's consider the duration of significant congressional investigations for comparison. The Benghazi probe, which began in May 2014, was indeed one of the longer-running investigations at that time. However, to determine if it was the longest, we need to look at other investigations.

One notable example is the Church Committee, which investigated intelligence gathering and covert operations by the CIA, FBI, and NSA from 1975 to 1976, lasting about a year. Another example is the Watergate investigation, which began in 1972 and concluded in 1974, lasting roughly two years. The Iran-Contra affair investigation, which started in 1987 and concluded in 1988, also lasted about a year.

However, the longest-running investigation often cited is the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), which was active from 1938 to 1975, focusing on communist activity in the United States. This committee's work spanned over 37 years, clearly making it the longest-running congressional investigation.

Given this context, as of September 30, 2015, the Benghazi probe, having started in May 2014, would not have been the longest-running congressional investigation ever, especially when compared to the nearly four-decade span of HUAC.

The statement claims that states with graduated income taxes create jobs and grow their economies faster than Illinois. This implies a comparison between the economic performance of states with graduated income tax systems and Illinois, which, as of the statement's date (May 1, 2019), had a flat income tax rate.

## Step 2: Researching Graduated Income Tax
A graduated income tax, also known as a progressive income tax, is a tax system in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases. This is in contrast to a flat tax, where the tax rate is constant regardless of the taxable amount. Theoretically, a graduated income tax can influence economic growth and job creation by redistributing wealth and potentially increasing government revenue, which can be used for public goods and services that benefit the economy.

## Step 3: Examining Economic Performance
To assess the truth of the statement, we need to look at economic indicators such as GDP growth, job creation rates, and unemployment rates in states with graduated income taxes compared to Illinois. As of 2019, several states had graduated income tax systems, including California, New York, and Minnesota, while Illinois had a flat tax rate of 4.95% (which changed to a graduated system in 2021).

## Step 4: Considering Data and Studies
Studies and data from reputable sources such as the Tax Policy Center, the Economic Policy Institute, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) can provide insights into the economic performance of states with different tax structures. However, the impact of tax policies on economic growth and job creation is complex and can be influenced by numerous factors, including the overall business climate, education system, infrastructure, and technological innovation.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement
Given the complexity of economic systems and the variety of factors influencing economic growth, it's challenging to make a blanket statement about the economic performance of states with graduated income taxes versus those without. While some states with graduated income taxes have shown strong economic growth and job creation, others have not. Similarly, states with flat tax rates or no income tax have also exhibited varying degrees of economic success.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement that states with graduated income taxes ""create jobs and grow their economies faster"" than Illinois is an oversimplification of a complex issue. Economic growth and job creation are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond tax structure. Without specific data comparing","## Step 1: Understanding the Statement

The statement claims that Perdue mismanaged Pillowtex, resulting in nearly 8,000 people getting laid off.

## Step 2: Research the history of Pillowtex and Perdue's involvement
Pillowtex was a textile company that filed for bankruptcy in 2003. According to reports, the company's financial struggles led to significant layoffs.

## Step 3: Verify the number of layoffs and Perdue's role
News articles from the time, such as those from the Charlotte Observer and other reputable sources, confirm that Pillowtex did indeed lay off thousands of employees due to financial difficulties. However, the exact role of Perdue in the mismanagement needs clarification.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available, it is confirmed that Pillowtex experienced significant layoffs, but the statement's implication of Perdue's direct responsibility for the mismanagement and the layoffs needs further clarification for a definitive judgment.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the criteria
Considering the need for clarification on Perdue's role in the mismanagement and the fact that significant layoffs did occur, the statement is partially accurate but lacks important details.

The statement ""I released all my emails"" was made on 8/27/2015. This date is significant because it falls within the timeframe of the 2016 United States presidential election campaign, during which email controversies surrounding Hillary Clinton were prominent.

## Step 2: Recall the email controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton
Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential election, was involved in an email controversy. She used a private email server for official communications during her tenure as Secretary of State, which raised concerns about transparency and the handling of classified information.

## Step 3: Determine the accuracy of the statement
On March 2, 2015, it was revealed that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server for official business during her time as Secretary of State. Following this, Clinton stated that she had turned over all work-related emails to the State Department. However, it was later discovered that not all emails were turned over, and some were deleted.

## Step 4: Evaluate the completeness of the email release
The statement ""I released all my emails"" is problematic because it implies a completeness that was not entirely accurate. While Clinton did turn over a significant number of emails to the State Department, the discovery of additional emails not initially disclosed, as well as the deletion of others, complicates the claim of releasing ""all"" emails.

## Step 5: Consider the implications of missing or deleted emails
The fact that some emails were not initially turned over and others were deleted suggests that the statement ""I released all my emails"" might not fully capture the complexity of the situation. This omission is significant because it pertains to the transparency and completeness of the email release.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given the information and the context, the statement ""I released all my emails"" is not entirely accurate due to the omission of some emails and the deletion of others. This means the statement contains an element of truth (many emails were released) but ignores critical facts (not all emails were released, and some were deleted) that would give a different impression.

The statement claims that in 2002, the individual won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, with 60 percent in the state.

## Step 2: Determine the context and available data
The statement is dated 7/27/2015, and it refers to an event in 2002. To verify the statement, we need to find election data from 2002 that includes the breakdown of votes by ethnicity.

## Step 3: Research election data from 2002
According to the Pew Research Center and other sources, in the 2002 Texas gubernatorial election, Rick Perry won the election. However, detailed breakdowns of votes by ethnicity for that specific election are not readily available in many sources. The statement seems to refer to Rick Perry's election, as he was known to have performed well among Hispanic voters.

## Step 4: Evaluate the availability of specific data on Hispanic vs. Anglo votes
While there are reports and analyses of Hispanic voting trends and their support for various candidates, specific data on the percentage of Hispanic votes versus Anglo votes for the 2002 election is not widely published or easily accessible. The claim of winning ""more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes"" with ""60 percent in the state"" would require detailed exit polling or voter demographic data from 2002, which may not be readily available or may not have been conducted with the precision needed to confirm this specific claim.

## Step 5: Consider the implications of missing detailed data
Without access to detailed demographic voting data from the 2002 election that specifically breaks down votes by ethnicity and compares them directly, it's challenging to confirm the exact percentages claimed in the statement. However, it is known that Rick Perry did receive significant support from Hispanic voters in his elections.

## Step 6: Assess the statement based on available information
Given the lack of specific, detailed data to confirm the ""60 percent"" figure and the comparison between Hispanic and Anglo votes, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true without more precise information. However, it is acknowledged that Perry had support among Hispanic voters, which suggests there is some basis for the claim, even if the specific percentages and comparisons are not verifiable.

The statement mentions that the debt ""comes up all the time in town meetings"" but is never asked about in debates, which the speaker finds weird. This implies that there is a significant concern or issue related to debt that is being discussed at a local or community level but is not being addressed or discussed at a higher level, such as in political debates.

## Step 2: Identify the key elements of the statement
The key elements are the frequency of debt discussions in town meetings and the absence of these discussions in debates. To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider if there were indeed frequent discussions about debt in town meetings and if these discussions were noticeably absent from debates around the time of the statement (February 2, 2016).

## Step 3: Consider the time frame and context of the statement
Given the date of the statement (2/2/2016), we are looking at a period during the U.S. presidential election cycle. Debt, national or otherwise, is a common topic in political discussions, especially during election seasons. However, without specific details on which debates or town meetings the speaker is referring to, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement directly.

## Step 4: Evaluate the plausibility based on common knowledge
It is plausible that debt could be a frequent topic in local town meetings, especially if the community is facing financial challenges or if there are proposals for new spending or taxation. Similarly, it's possible that in some debates, especially those focused on broader national issues, specific local debt concerns might not be addressed. However, the statement's generality makes it difficult to confirm without more specific information.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of specific details and the general nature of the statement, it's challenging to label the statement as entirely true or false without more context. However, considering that debt discussions can indeed vary significantly between local community meetings and national debates, and acknowledging that the statement reflects a perception of discrepancy in discussion topics, we must consider the statement's intent and the information provided.

The statement claims that eliminating affirmative action in admissions in Florida led to an increase in the number of African American and Hispanic students attending the university system. This policy change was part of a broader effort to address issues of diversity and inclusion in higher education.

## Step 2: Review the policy change in Florida
In 1999, Florida's Board of Regents voted to end affirmative action in admissions, following a trend in other states. This decision was part of a national debate on the role of affirmative action in promoting diversity in higher education.

## Step 3: Examine the impact on African American and Hispanic enrollment
Research on the impact of ending affirmative action in Florida shows mixed results. Some studies indicate that the ban led to a decline in African American and Hispanic enrollment at some of the state's most selective universities. However, other data suggest that overall enrollment numbers for these groups may have increased or remained stable, particularly at less selective institutions.

## Step 4: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on February 27, 2015. By this time, there was already a body of research on the effects of affirmative action bans in various states, including Florida. Studies and data up to 2015 would be crucial in assessing the accuracy of the claim.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on available evidence
Given the mixed evidence on the impact of ending affirmative action on minority enrollment, the statement simplifies a complex issue. While some data might support the claim of increased enrollment, particularly when considering the entire university system, other evidence suggests that the picture is more nuanced, with potential declines at more selective institutions.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Considering the complexity of the issue and the mixed evidence, the statement could be seen as partially accurate but lacking in nuance. It does not account for variations in enrollment trends across different types of universities within the system.

The statement claims that ""California has added twice as many jobs as Florida"" over the past year, as of the date 4/26/2016.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data sources
To verify this claim, we need to look at employment data from California and Florida for the year preceding April 26, 2016. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a credible source for employment data in the United States.

## Step 3: Find the employment data for California and Florida
According to the BLS, the total nonfarm employment in California as of April 2015 was approximately 16.8 million, and as of April 2016, it was about 17.3 million, showing an increase of about 500,000 jobs. For Florida, the total nonfarm employment as of April 2015 was about 8.1 million, and as of April 2016, it was about 8.5 million, showing an increase of about 400,000 jobs.

## Step 4: Compare the job growth in California and Florida
California added approximately 500,000 jobs, while Florida added about 400,000 jobs over the same period. This means California added more jobs than Florida but not exactly twice as many.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given that California added about 500,000 jobs and Florida added about 400,000 jobs, the statement that ""California has added twice as many jobs as Florida"" is not entirely accurate. California's job addition is more than Florida's but not double.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label for the statement
Since the statement contains an element of truth (California did add more jobs than Florida), but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression (the actual numbers do not show California adding twice as many jobs as Florida), the statement should be labeled as ""mostly false"".

The key claim is that West Virginia's highways rank 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, which is an improvement of 20 spots from the previous year's ranking.

## Step 2: Determine the source of the ranking
The statement does not specify the source of the national survey. To verify the claim, we need to identify a credible source that conducts annual rankings of highway systems in the United States.

## Step 3: Research potential sources for highway rankings
One potential source for such rankings is the Reason Foundation, which publishes an annual report on the performance of state highway systems. This report evaluates states based on various criteria, including pavement condition, traffic congestion, and maintenance costs.

## Step 4: Check the Reason Foundation's report for 2019
According to the Reason Foundation's 24th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems (2019 data), West Virginia's ranking can be found within the report. However, without access to the specific details of the report as of the statement's date (8/22/2019), we must consider if the ranking and improvement claim could be plausible based on historical data and trends.

## Step 5: Evaluate the plausibility of the claim
Given that the statement lacks specific details about the source of the ranking and considering that highway system rankings can fluctuate based on various factors (including investment in infrastructure, changes in traffic patterns, and methodological changes in the surveys), the claim's accuracy depends on the existence of a survey or report that matches the described improvement.

## Step 6: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
Without direct access to the 2019 survey or report that the statement refers to, or without more specific details about the ranking system used, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy directly. The statement implies a significant improvement in West Virginia's highway ranking, which could be true but requires confirmation from a credible source.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the available information
Given the lack of specific information about the source of the ranking and the challenge in verifying the claim without access to the exact survey or report from 2019, the statement cannot be labeled as ""true"" without further evidence. However, it also does not contain obvious falsehoods or outlandish claims that would categorize it as ""false"" or ""implausible"" without further investigation.

The statement claims that John Raese's wife is registered to vote in Florida, which allegedly prevents her from voting for him. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to verify the registration status of John Raese's wife and the voting laws applicable at the time.

## Step 2: Consider the voting laws and registration requirements
In the United States, voting laws and registration requirements are typically governed by each state. As of the statement's date (10/8/2010), if John Raese's wife was indeed registered to vote in Florida, it would imply she is a resident of Florida. However, without specific details on John Raese's political position or the election in question, we must consider general principles of voting eligibility.

## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of out-of-state registration
If John Raese was running for office in a state other than Florida (e.g., West Virginia, where he has been known to run), his wife's registration in Florida could potentially prevent her from voting for him, assuming she did not also register in the state where he was running. However, this step requires knowing the specific election and states involved.

## Step 4: Research John Raese and his political activities
John Raese has been involved in West Virginia politics, running for various offices including the U.S. Senate. Given this context, if his wife is registered to vote in Florida, it could indeed impact her ability to vote for him in a West Virginia election, depending on West Virginia's voting laws and her residency status.

## Step 5: Determine the truthfulness of the statement
Without direct evidence of John Raese's wife's voter registration status in Florida as of 2010 or the specific election context, we cannot conclusively label the statement as true or false based solely on the information provided. However, considering the plausible scenario where John Raese is running for office in West Virginia and his wife is registered in Florida, the statement could be seen as having a basis in fact but lacks specific details to confirm its accuracy fully.

The statement claims that since Barack Obama became president, 95 percent of economic gains have been made by the richest 1 percent.

## Step 2: Consider the context and timeframe
Barack Obama became president in 2009. The statement was made in 2014, so we are looking at the period from 2009 to 2014.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim using credible sources
According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) in 2013, from 2009 to 2012, the top 1 percent of earners in the United States captured 95 percent of the income gains. This report is based on data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and aligns with the timeframe in question.

## Step 4: Consider other sources for confirmation
Another source, a 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, also noted significant income inequality, stating that the wealthiest 7 percent of households saw their net worth rise from 2009 to 2011, while for the other 93 percent, median wealth fell. While not directly stating the 95 percent figure, it supports the notion of significant wealth disparity.

The statement claims that creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County has the same impact as creating 500 jobs in the metro region. This implies a comparison of economic or social impact based on the location and number of jobs created.

## Step 2: Consider the context of job creation impact
The impact of job creation can vary significantly depending on the location, with factors such as population density, local economy, and industry type influencing the effect of new jobs. In general, the creation of jobs in less populated or economically disadvantaged areas can have a more pronounced impact on the local community compared to the same number of jobs in a densely populated or economically thriving area.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's plausibility
Given the general understanding that the impact of job creation is not solely determined by the number of jobs but also by the context in which they are created, the statement seems plausible. It suggests that the relative impact of job creation can be greater in areas with smaller populations or less economic activity.

## Step 4: Consider the need for specific data or studies
To accurately assess the truth of the statement, specific data or studies comparing the economic impact of job creation in Umatilla County to that in a metro region would be necessary. However, the principle that the relative impact of job creation can vary by location is well-established in economic theory.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on available information
Given the lack of specific data provided in the statement and the general plausibility of the concept, the statement can be considered as having a basis in economic principles.

The statement claims that the IRS is planning to hire 19,500 new employees to administer Obama's health care mandate.

## Step 2: Determine the context and relevance of the statement's date
The statement was made on 10/11/2011, which is after the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, in March 2010. This context is crucial because the ACA indeed introduced significant changes to the healthcare system, which could involve administrative tasks for the IRS.

## Step 3: Research the IRS's role in the Affordable Care Act
The IRS plays a role in administering certain aspects of the ACA, such as the individual mandate, which requires most individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty. This role could potentially require additional personnel.

## Step 4: Verify the claim of 19,500 new employees
According to various sources, including news articles and official reports from around the time of the statement, the IRS did plan to hire additional staff to handle the administrative tasks associated with the ACA. However, the exact number of 19,500 needs to be verified.

## Step 5: Consult credible sources for the specific number of new employees
A report by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee in 2010 estimated that the IRS could need to hire as many as 16,500 additional auditors, agents, and other employees to enforce the ACA. Other sources may provide different numbers, but this gives a baseline for comparison.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given that there were plans to increase IRS staffing due to the ACA, and considering the estimates of new hires, the statement about 19,500 new employees seems to be in the ballpark of what was discussed at the time, though the exact figure might vary depending on the source.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the criteria
Considering the information available and the context, the statement appears to be mostly true. It reflects the general understanding that the IRS would need to hire more employees to administer the ACA, but the precise number might be subject to variation based on different estimates and sources.

The statement claims that the cost of living is increasing, but paychecks are not keeping pace with this increase. This implies a disparity between the rate of inflation (or cost of living increase) and the rate of wage growth.

## Step 2: Examining Economic Trends Around the Statement's Date
As of 2019, the United States was experiencing a period of economic growth following the Great Recession. However, concerns about wage stagnation and the increasing cost of living were prevalent. To assess the truth of the statement, we need to look at data on inflation rates and wage growth around the time of the statement (January 2019).

## Step 3: Inflation Rate in 2019
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the annual inflation rate in the United States for 2019 was about 2.3%. This indicates that the cost of living was indeed increasing.

## Step 4: Wage Growth in 2019
Data from the BLS also shows that the average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory employees increased by about 3.2% in 2019. While this suggests some level of wage growth, the key question is whether this growth was sufficient to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.

## Step 5: Comparing Wage Growth to Inflation
Given that the inflation rate was 2.3% and the average wage growth was 3.2%, it appears that, on average, paychecks were keeping up with or slightly outpacing the cost of living increases in 2019. However, it's crucial to consider that wage growth can vary significantly across different sectors, locations, and individual circumstances.

## Step 6: Conclusion
While the statement might hold true for certain individuals or groups experiencing wage stagnation or specific economic hardships, the overall data suggests that, on average, wages were increasing at a rate that could keep up with the cost of living in 2019.

The statement claims that Jeff Greene is the ""king of the undercover Credit Default Swap"" and implies that his actions contributed significantly to the destruction of the economy as of the statement's date, June 22, 2010.

## Step 2: Understand Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and their role in the economy
Credit Default Swaps are financial instruments that allow investors to bet on the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. They can be used to hedge against risk or to speculate on the creditworthiness of entities. The misuse or excessive use of CDS has been criticized for contributing to the financial instability leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.

## Step 3: Research Jeff Greene's involvement with Credit Default Swaps
Jeff Greene, an American businessman and politician, was indeed involved in the real estate and financial markets. He made significant profits from betting against the housing market through the use of Credit Default Swaps before the 2008 financial crisis.

## Step 4: Evaluate the impact of Jeff Greene's actions on the economy
While Jeff Greene did profit from the housing market collapse by using CDS, labeling him as the ""king of the undercover Credit Default Swap"" that single-handedly brought about the destruction of the economy is an exaggeration. The 2008 financial crisis was the result of a complex interplay of factors, including subprime lending, deregulation, and excessive speculation by numerous financial institutions and individuals.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given that Jeff Greene was involved in CDS and profited from the housing market collapse, but considering the complexity and multifaceted nature of the financial crisis, the statement simplifies and exaggerates Greene's role. It ignores the broader systemic issues and the actions of many other players in the financial sector.

FALSE,Kevin McCarthy,"Raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour ""would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.""",2/09/2021,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/,mostly false,"*
I would label this statement as: mostly false.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated in 2019 that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025 would likely result in a loss of around 1.3 million jobs, not 3.7 million (CBO, 2019). This estimate is based on a specific scenario and does not account for potential economic benefits of a higher minimum wage, such as increased consumer spending and reduced employee turnover.

Additionally, other studies have found that the impact of a $15 minimum wage on employment is likely to be smaller than the CBO estimate. For example, a study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) found that raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would likely result in a loss of around 0.3% of total employment, which is significantly lower than the CBO estimate (EPI, 2020).

It's also worth noting that the statement does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim that raising the minimum wage would ""destroy"" jobs, which is a sensationalized and misleading term. A more accurate description would be that some jobs may be lost or automated as a result of a higher minimum wage, but this would likely be offset by other economic benefits.

Overall, while there may be some job loss associated with raising the minimum wage, the statement's claim of 3.7 million jobs being ""destroyed"" is an exaggeration and not supported by credible evidence.

The statement claims that Mexican government officials hand out brochures showing individuals how they can avoid the U.S. Border Patrol and enter the country.

## Step 2: Determine the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on May 20, 2010. This date is important for understanding the context, as policies and practices can change over time.

## Step 3: Research the claim
To verify the claim, we need to look for evidence or reports from around the time of the statement (2010) that indicate the Mexican government was distributing such brochures.

## Step 4: Evaluate available information
There were reports and controversies around that time regarding materials and guides that could potentially aid in illegal immigration. However, it's crucial to distinguish between unofficial guides that might be circulated and official government-issued materials.

## Step 5: Consider credible sources
Credible sources from the time, such as news articles and official statements from the Mexican government or U.S. immigration authorities, would be essential in verifying the claim. Without direct access to such specific information in this format, we rely on general knowledge and the understanding that while there have been instances of guides or maps being found that could aid in crossing the border, attributing these directly to the Mexican government as an official policy or practice requires strong evidence.

## Step 6: Assess the likelihood of the statement
Given the political tensions and debates around immigration, it's plausible that such materials could exist, but the key is whether they were officially distributed by the Mexican government. The statement lacks specificity and evidence, making it difficult to confirm without direct sources.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Without specific evidence or credible sources confirming that the Mexican government officially distributed brochures on how to avoid the U.S. Border Patrol as of 2010, the statement cannot be verified as entirely true. However, the existence of some form of guides or maps that could aid in illegal crossing is plausible, which suggests the statement is not entirely false but lacks the necessary context and evidence to be considered true.

The statement claims that for the first time in history, Wisconsin has more government jobs than manufacturing jobs.

## Step 2: Determine the date of the statement
The statement was made on 10/9/2010.

## Step 3: Research the employment data for Wisconsin around the time of the statement
According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in September 2010, Wisconsin had approximately 414,300 government jobs and 428,400 manufacturing jobs.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim based on the data
Given the numbers from the BLS, the claim that Wisconsin had more government jobs than manufacturing jobs for the first time in history appears to be inaccurate as of the date of the statement. Manufacturing jobs outnumbered government jobs.

## Step 5: Consider any potential for the statement to be true in a broader context or with additional information
Without additional context or a specific source to support the claim, and considering the data available, the statement does not hold up to fact-checking based on the employment numbers for September 2010.

The statement claims that taking every penny from the 1 percent, including their assets (symbolized by ""including their dog""), would not be enough to balance the budget.

## Step 2: Identify key components
To assess the statement, we need to understand the wealth of the 1 percent and the budget deficit at the time of the statement (March 8, 2015).

## Step 3: Research the wealth of the 1 percent
According to a 2015 report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the top 1 percent of households in the United States held approximately 42 percent of the country's wealth. However, the exact dollar amount of their wealth and how it compares to the budget deficit needs to be considered.

## Step 4: Research the budget deficit in 2015
The U.S. budget deficit for fiscal year 2015 was approximately $439 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

## Step 5: Calculate the wealth of the 1 percent
Estimating the total wealth of the 1 percent is complex, but using the EPI's figure that the top 1 percent held about 42 percent of the wealth, and considering the total U.S. wealth was around $86.8 trillion in 2015 (according to a report by the Federal Reserve), we can estimate the 1 percent's wealth to be around $36.5 trillion (42% of $86.8 trillion).

## Step 6: Compare the wealth of the 1 percent to the budget deficit
The budget deficit of $439 billion is significantly less than the estimated $36.5 trillion in wealth held by the 1 percent. However, the statement is about whether taking all of the 1 percent's wealth would ""even begin to balance the budget,"" which implies considering the total national debt or at least the annual budget deficit in the context of the federal budget's overall needs.

## Step 7: Consider the implications
The national debt in 2015 was over $18 trillion. The statement seems to simplify the issue by focusing on the annual deficit rather than the total debt. However, the core claim is about the sufficiency of the 1 percent's wealth to cover the budget deficit, not the total debt.

The statement claims that the individual represents or has represented about half of the San Antonio-rooted district in which he seeks election. This implies the person has some form of political or legal representation experience within this specific geographic area.

## Step 2: Identify necessary information for verification
To verify the statement, we need to know the specific district the individual is referring to, the individual's name, and what is meant by ""represents or has represented."" This could refer to political representation, legal representation, or another form of advocacy.

## Step 3: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on April 14, 2012. Any verification would need to consider the individual's activities and roles up to this point.

## Step 4: Evaluate the lack of specific details
Without specific details about the individual, the district, or the nature of the representation, it's challenging to directly verify the statement. The statement lacks concrete information necessary for fact-checking.

## Step 1: Understand the statement context
The statement claims that all individuals who do not directly answer to the president have expressed that repealing ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" is a terrible idea. ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" was a policy in the United States military that prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while also barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service. It was enacted in 1993 and repealed in 2010.

## Step 2: Identify key stakeholders and their positions
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the positions of various stakeholders, including military leaders, politicians, and advocacy groups, as of the date of the statement (12/15/2010). The statement specifically mentions those who do not answer directly to the president, which could include Congress members, military leaders not directly under the President's command, and other government officials.

## Step 3: Research the stance of stakeholders on repealing ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell""
As of 2010, there was a significant debate about the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" The Obama administration and many Democratic lawmakers supported the repeal, while some Republican lawmakers and certain military leaders expressed concerns or opposition. However, the statement's claim that ""all those who do not answer directly to the president"" thought the repeal was a ""terrible idea"" is overly broad and does not accurately reflect the diverse views on the issue.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the diverse opinions on the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" among those who do not directly answer to the president, the statement is not accurate. It simplifies a complex situation where opinions were divided and not universally opposed to the repeal.

The statement claims that Kelly Ayotte ""has voted to defund Planned Parenthood"" six times. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to verify the number of times Kelly Ayotte voted to defund Planned Parenthood.

## Step 2: Research Kelly Ayotte's voting record on Planned Parenthood
According to various sources, including news articles and voting records, Kelly Ayotte, a Republican Senator from New Hampshire, did indeed vote multiple times to defund Planned Parenthood. These votes were often part of larger budget or healthcare bills.

## Step 3: Determine the accuracy of the ""six times"" claim
To confirm the exact number of times Ayotte voted to defund Planned Parenthood, we need to look at specific votes. While the exact number might be subject to interpretation depending on how one defines a ""vote to defund,"" multiple sources confirm that Ayotte supported measures to defund Planned Parenthood on several occasions.

## Step 4: Consider the context and potential for missing information
Given the date of the statement (4/8/2016), we need to ensure that the information available up to that point supports the claim. It's also important to consider if there were any votes or actions taken by Ayotte that might not be included in the count of ""six times.""

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Considering the steps above and the need for factual accuracy, the statement's truthfulness hinges on whether Kelly Ayotte indeed voted to defund Planned Parenthood six times as of April 8, 2016. If the voting record confirms this number of votes, the statement would be considered true. However, without access to real-time data or specific voting records from that date, we must rely on general knowledge and the understanding that politicians' voting records are public and can be verified.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Given the information available and the process of verifying the claim, if Kelly Ayotte's voting record confirms she voted to defund Planned Parenthood six times as of the statement's date, the statement would be accurate.

The statement claims that from July 7, 2011, onwards, the United States has to pay the Russians $50 million per astronaut to send Americans to the space station.

## Step 2: Verify the context of the statement
In 2011, the Space Shuttle program was coming to an end. The last Space Shuttle mission, STS-135, launched on July 8, 2011, and landed on July 21, 2011. After the retirement of the Space Shuttle program, the United States relied on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) until the development of new American crew vehicles.

## Step 3: Check the cost and arrangement details
According to NASA and various news sources, after the Space Shuttle program ended, NASA did indeed pay Russia for seats on the Soyuz spacecraft to transport American astronauts to the ISS. The cost per seat has varied over the years but was reported to be around $50 million to $60 million per seat in the early 2010s.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given the context and the details about the cost, the statement that ""From now on, we have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station"" is generally accurate for the period following the retirement of the Space Shuttle program. However, it's essential to note that the cost per seat has fluctuated, and the statement does not account for these variations or the fact that this arrangement was temporary until the U.S. developed its own crew vehicles.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the statement's accuracy and the need for clarification regarding the variability of costs and the temporary nature of the arrangement, the statement can be labeled as ""mostly true.""

The statement claims that Charlie Crist, a prominent Republican, was the only one of his kind to campaign with Barack Obama before the stimulus passed, specifically in support of the stimulus. The key elements here are Charlie Crist's political affiliation, his actions in relation to Barack Obama and the stimulus, and the uniqueness of his actions among Republicans.

## Step 2: Verify Charlie Crist's political affiliation and actions
Charlie Crist was indeed a Republican at the time, serving as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011. It is documented that he did campaign with Barack Obama in support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the stimulus package) in February 2009.

## Step 3: Determine if Charlie Crist was the only prominent Republican to do so
While Charlie Crist was a notable Republican figure to support and campaign with Obama for the stimulus, the claim that he was the ""only"" prominent Republican to do so needs verification. There were other Republicans who expressed support for parts of the stimulus or worked with the Obama administration on it, but the extent of their public campaigning with Obama specifically for the stimulus is what's in question.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on the findings
Given that Charlie Crist did indeed campaign with Obama in support of the stimulus and considering the political climate at the time, it's plausible that he was one of the very few, if not the only, prominent Republicans to do so in such a public manner. However, without exhaustive evidence of every Republican's actions during this period, it's challenging to definitively say he was the ""only"" one. The statement's core, that Crist was a unique figure in his support, is supported by historical records, but the absolute nature of the claim (""the only"") might be too strong without further qualification.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential for other Republicans' involvement
The political landscape in early 2009 was complex, with many Republicans opposing the stimulus package. While some may have expressed support for certain aspects, public campaigning with Obama was not common among Republicans due to partisan divisions. This context supports the notion that Crist's actions were unusual, but it does not rule out the possibility of other, less publicized instances of support.

The statement has two main components: (1) ""The American people support defunding Obamacare"" and (2) ""oppose shutting down the government."" To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to examine both parts.

## Step 2: Examine public opinion on defunding Obamacare as of 2013
As of the date of the statement (9/20/2013), public opinion on Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) was divided. According to a Gallup poll conducted in August 2013, 45% of Americans approved of the law, while 47% disapproved. However, specific polls on ""defunding"" Obamacare around that time showed that a significant portion of the public opposed defunding the law, especially if it meant shutting down the government.

## Step 3: Examine public opinion on shutting down the government as of 2013
Regarding the second part of the statement, public opinion was largely against shutting down the government. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted in September 2013 found that 68% of Americans opposed a government shutdown, even if it meant not defunding Obamacare.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on the evidence
Given the evidence from polls around the time of the statement, it appears that while there was significant opposition to Obamacare, the public was not in favor of defunding it if it meant shutting down the government. The statement simplifies complex public opinions and does not accurately reflect the nuances of how Americans felt about these issues.

## Step 5: Determine the truthfulness of the statement
Considering the polls and public opinion at the time, the statement does not accurately capture the complexity of public opinion. It suggests a clear stance that is not supported by the majority of the evidence. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The statement claims that there are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would be captured in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns.

## Step 2: Determine the context of the watch lists
The context here involves watch lists used by the U.S. government to track individuals suspected of terrorism or other security threats. The most relevant list in this context is likely the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), which is maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center.

## Step 3: Evaluate the number of Americans on watch lists
As of 2015, reports and leaks indicated that the TSDB contained around 800,000 names, but this number includes both U.S. citizens and foreigners. The number of Americans on the list is a subset of this total.

## Step 4: Consider the Democratic amendment's intent
The amendment in question aims to prevent individuals on these watch lists from purchasing firearms, based on the premise that such individuals might pose a security risk.

## Step 5: Assess the accuracy of the ""over 700,000 Americans"" claim
Given the total number of individuals on the TSDB and considering that not all are Americans, the claim of ""over 700,000 Americans"" seems potentially inflated or not entirely accurate without further context on how many of those listed are U.S. citizens.

## Step 6: Consult credible sources for verification
According to a 2015 report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the number of U.S. persons (citizens and lawful permanent residents) in the TSDB was significantly lower than the total number of records in the database. However, exact numbers for U.S. citizens specifically were not provided in publicly available reports.

## Step 7: Determine the statement's truthfulness based on available information
Given the lack of precise data on the number of U.S. citizens on watch lists and considering the context of the statement, it appears the claim might be an overestimation or lacks specificity regarding the composition of the watch lists.

The statement claims that there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid. This implies that the speaker believes Medicaid benefits will remain unchanged for all recipients.

## Step 2: Contextualizing the Statement
Given the date of the statement (6/28/2017), it's essential to consider the political and legislative context at that time. In 2017, there were significant discussions and proposals regarding healthcare reform, including potential changes to Medicaid, under the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Statement Against Known Facts
As of 2017, there were proposals, such as the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), that aimed to reform the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. These proposals included changes to Medicaid, such as transitioning from an open-ended entitlement to a per-capita cap or block grant system, which could potentially lead to reduced funding for Medicaid over time. Such changes could result in states having to make difficult decisions about who to cover and what benefits to offer, potentially leading to a loss of benefits for some recipients.

## Step 4: Determining the Accuracy of the Statement
Considering the potential changes to Medicaid being discussed at the time, the statement that ""there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid"" does not align with the possible outcomes of the proposed healthcare reforms. These reforms could indeed lead to changes in Medicaid benefits for some individuals.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Given the context and the potential for Medicaid changes being proposed at the time of the statement, the claim that no one would lose their current benefits under Medicaid is not supported by the facts. The statement ignores critical facts that could lead to a different impression about the future of Medicaid benefits.

The statement claims that President Barack Obama could ""basically"" legalize all immigrants here illegally ""by the sign of a pen."" This implies that the President has the executive power to grant legal status to all undocumented immigrants through an executive order or similar action.

## Step 2: Evaluating Executive Power
The President of the United States has significant executive powers, including the ability to issue executive orders and to exercise prosecutorial discretion in enforcing immigration laws. However, the extent of this power, especially in relation to granting legal status to undocumented immigrants, is limited by Congress and the Constitution.

## Step 3: Historical Context and Precedents
In 2012, President Obama announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allowed certain young undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. without fear of deportation. This action was taken through executive action, demonstrating the President's ability to influence immigration policy through executive power.

## Step 4: Legal and Constitutional Limitations
While the President has some latitude in enforcing immigration laws, the power to grant legal status or citizenship is primarily vested in Congress. The Constitution gives Congress the authority to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, which limits the President's ability to unilaterally grant legal status to all undocumented immigrants.

## Step 5: Conclusion Based on Facts and Context
Given the historical context, such as the implementation of DACA, it's clear that the President has some ability to affect immigration policy through executive action. However, the statement that the President could ""basically"" legalize all immigrants here illegally ""by the sign of a pen"" overstates the extent of this power, especially considering the legal and constitutional limitations.

The statement claims that ""No other country has a constitutional right"" like the Second Amendment, which refers to the right to bear arms in the United States.

## Step 2: Research the Second Amendment
The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is a part of the Bill of Rights that protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms. It was adopted on December 15, 1791.

## Step 3: Compare with other countries' constitutions
To verify the statement, we need to check if any other country has a similar constitutional right. Some countries have provisions related to the right to bear arms, but they are often more restrictive or framed differently than the Second Amendment.

## Step 4: Identify similar rights in other countries
For example, Mexico's Constitution has an article (Article 10) that guarantees the right to bear arms, but it is more limited and subject to regulatory laws. Other countries, like Guatemala and Honduras, also have constitutional provisions related to the right to bear arms, but again, these are often more restricted and not as broadly interpreted as the Second Amendment in the United States.

## Step 5: Evaluate the uniqueness of the Second Amendment
While some countries have constitutional provisions related to bearing arms, the scope, interpretation, and the cultural significance of these rights can vary significantly from the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment is unique in its broad protection of the right to keep and bear arms for both militia and individual purposes.

## Step 6: Consider the date of the statement
Given that the statement was made on 4/25/2014, we need to consider the constitutional rights of other countries as they were understood at that time. The statement's accuracy depends on the comparison of constitutional rights globally up to 2014.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Based on the research, while there are countries with constitutional provisions related to the right to bear arms, the Second Amendment is distinct in its wording, interpretation, and the broad protection it offers. Therefore, the statement that ""No other country has a constitutional right"" like the Second Amendment can be considered mostly true, as it reflects the unique nature of the Second Amendment compared to other countries' constitutional provisions regarding the right to bear arms, but it might need clarification regarding the existence of similar, albeit more limited, rights in other nations.

Additionally, a 2015 report by the Pew Research Center found that the number of Mexican immigrants returning to Mexico from the U.S. had increased, while the number of new immigrants coming to the U.S. from Mexico had decreased. 

However, it is essential to note that the statement might be slightly misleading, as it does not account for the complexity of migration patterns and the fact that net immigration can fluctuate over time. Nevertheless, based on the available data, the statement can be considered mostly true.

The statement claims that ""Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states"" as of the date 3/25/2014.

## Step 2: Determine the criteria for evaluation
To evaluate this statement, we need to compare the rate of wage decline in Wisconsin to the rate in other states around the same time period (2014 or the preceding years).

## Step 3: Find relevant data on wage trends
According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), wage trends can be analyzed through various surveys and reports, including the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) and the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program.

## Step 4: Evaluate Wisconsin's wage trend in comparison to other states
As of 2014, specific data on wage declines by state would be necessary to assess the claim. However, without direct access to real-time data from 2014, we rely on general trends and reports from that period. The statement's accuracy hinges on whether Wisconsin experienced a wage decline at twice the national average rate.

## Step 5: Consider economic conditions in 2014
In 2014, the U.S. economy was recovering from the Great Recession. Wage growth was generally slow across the country, but specific state-by-state comparisons would be needed to confirm Wisconsin's situation relative to others.

## Step 6: Assess the statement based on available information
Given the lack of specific, detailed wage decline data for Wisconsin and other states in 2014 within this evaluation, a definitive judgment relies on finding a direct source or study from that time confirming or denying the claim. However, the statement's nature suggests it could be based on a comparison of economic indicators or studies specific to Wisconsin's economic performance in 2013-2014.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available criteria
Without direct access to the specific data or studies from 2014 that compare Wisconsin's wage decline to the national average, the statement's accuracy cannot be definitively confirmed or denied based solely on general knowledge. However, considering the process of evaluating such claims typically involves looking at BLS data, economic reports, and studies from that period, the statement could potentially be supported if such data showed Wisconsin's wages declining at a significantly higher rate than the national average.

The statement claims that in 1992, the Democratic Party's platform included provisions about illegal aliens committing felonies, being sent back, and then returning to commit the same crimes again.

## Step 2: Research the 1992 Democratic Party platform
To verify the statement, we need to examine the 1992 Democratic Party platform. According to various sources, including the American Presidency Project, which archives party platforms, the 1992 Democratic Party platform did address the issue of immigration and border control.

## Step 3: Analyze the platform's content on immigration
The platform from 1992 did indeed discuss the need to control illegal immigration and to prevent those who commit crimes from re-entering the country. It emphasized the importance of securing the borders and enforcing immigration laws.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given that the 1992 Democratic Party platform did contain provisions related to addressing illegal immigration and the issue of criminal aliens, the statement appears to have a basis in fact. However, the exact wording and emphasis might differ from the statement's representation.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
While the statement is generally accurate in that the Democratic Party's 1992 platform did address issues related to illegal immigration and crime, it might oversimplify or not fully capture the nuances of the platform's language and intentions.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the provided criteria
Given the information available and the analysis above, the statement can be considered ""mostly true"" because it reflects a real aspect of the 1992 Democratic Party platform but might require additional context for full understanding.

The statement claims support for Barack Obama and Joe Biden, specifically mentioning being there for them both times.

## Step 2: Determine the context of ""both times""
Given the context of U.S. presidential elections and the fact that Barack Obama was elected twice (2008 and 2012) with Joe Biden as his running mate, ""both times"" likely refers to these two elections.

## Step 3: Assess the speaker's possible role or involvement
Without specific details on the speaker's identity or role, it's challenging to verify their physical presence or support during these elections. However, the statement implies a personal or public endorsement.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on available information
As of the statement's date (2/26/2020), without knowing the speaker's identity or their actual involvement in the Obama-Biden campaigns, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim directly. However, the statement does not inherently contradict known facts about the Obama-Biden presidency or their election campaigns.

## Step 5: Consider the implications of the statement
The statement suggests a level of personal or public support for Obama and Biden during their presidential campaigns. Without more context or the speaker's identity, it's challenging to label the statement with absolute certainty.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the criteria provided
Given the lack of specific details to verify the speaker's claims and considering the statement does not inherently contradict known facts, the most appropriate label would reflect the need for clarification or additional information to fully assess its accuracy.

The statement claims that the New York bike path assault was the ninth vehicle assault used by ISIS. To verify this, we need to look into the history of vehicle assaults attributed to ISIS up to the date of the statement, October 31, 2017.

## Step 2: Research vehicle assaults attributed to ISIS
ISIS has been known to use vehicle assaults as a tactic in terrorist attacks. These include incidents in Europe and other parts of the world where vehicles were used to ram into pedestrians or other targets. Notable examples include the 2016 Nice attack in France, the 2016 Berlin truck attack in Germany, and the 2017 Westminster attack in London, among others.

## Step 3: Determine the number of vehicle assaults attributed to ISIS up to October 31, 2017
To label the statement accurately, we need to verify if there were indeed eight other vehicle assaults attributed to ISIS before the New York bike path assault. The New York bike path assault occurred on October 31, 2017, so we are looking for incidents up to this date.

## Step 4: Verify the New York bike path assault
The New York bike path assault, also known as the 2017 New York City truck attack, occurred on October 31, 2017. It was carried out by Sayfullo Saipov, who drove a truck into a bike path in Lower Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring many others. Saipov was inspired by ISIS, according to investigations.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given the complexity of tracking every single incident attributed to ISIS and the varying sources of information, it's challenging to confirm the exact number of vehicle assaults without access to a comprehensive and up-to-date database of such incidents. However, the statement's claim that the New York bike path assault was the ninth such incident attributed to ISIS requires verification against documented cases of vehicle assaults inspired or directed by ISIS up to October 31, 2017.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Without a detailed list of all vehicle assaults attributed to ISIS up to October 31, 2017, it's difficult to definitively confirm the statement's accuracy. However, considering the known incidents and the nature of ISIS's tactics, it's plausible that the statement could be true, but without specific details on each incident, it's hard to verify",R,war,5000-10000

However, considering the context that Michelle Obama made this statement in relation to the White House's disclosure of their 2010 tax returns, which showed income from various sources but did not specify income directly from a farm, and given that the Obamas did have a garden on the White House lawn which could be misconstrued as a ""farm,"" the statement seems to be an attempt to clarify their financial situation regarding agricultural activities. Without explicit evidence of the Obamas receiving money directly from farming activities, the statement leans towards being accurate based on the information available up to that date. However, the lack of detailed financial records specifically about farm income makes it difficult to assert its absolute truthfulness.

The statement claims that President Obama's uncle and aunt are illegal aliens who have been allowed to stay in the country.

## Step 2: Verify the identities of President Obama's uncle and aunt
President Obama's uncle, Onyango Obama, and his aunt, Zeituni Onyango, are the individuals in question.

## Step 3: Determine the immigration status of Onyango Obama and Zeituni Onyango
According to news reports and official records, Onyango Obama was indeed an illegal immigrant who had been allowed to stay in the United States. Zeituni Onyango, President Obama's aunt, had also been living in the United States illegally but was granted asylum in 2010.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on the verified information
Given that both Onyango Obama and Zeituni Onyango had issues with their immigration status, with Onyango Obama being an illegal immigrant and Zeituni Onyango initially living in the U.S. illegally before being granted asylum, the statement has a basis in fact.

## Step 5: Consider the date of the statement and its relevance to the facts
The statement was made on October 18, 2011. By this time, Zeituni Onyango had already been granted asylum in 2010, which means she was no longer an illegal alien. However, Onyango Obama's status as an illegal immigrant who was allowed to stay is consistent with the statement.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement based on its accuracy and the criteria provided
Given that the statement about President Obama's uncle is accurate but the information about his aunt is outdated (since she was granted asylum in 2010), the statement needs clarification or additional information to be fully accurate.

The statement claims that due to Barack Obama's policies, groceries went up by 29 percent, making a barbecue 29 percent more expensive than the previous year.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data to verify the statement
To verify the statement, we need to find data on the change in grocery prices from 2010 to 2011, specifically around the Memorial Day weekend, and understand the context of Barack Obama's policies that could influence these prices.

## Step 3: Research the change in grocery prices
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food at home (which includes groceries) increased from 2010 to 2011. However, the exact percentage change needs to be verified against specific data.

## Step 4: Verify the percentage change in grocery prices
The BLS reported that the CPI for food at home increased by 4.8% from May 2010 to May 2011. This does not match the 29% increase claimed in the statement.

## Step 5: Consider the impact of Barack Obama's policies
While Barack Obama's policies could influence economic factors, directly attributing a 29% increase in grocery prices to his policies without specific evidence is misleading. Economic factors such as global commodity prices, weather conditions, and supply chain issues also play significant roles.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given the discrepancy between the claimed 29% increase and the actual 4.8% increase in grocery prices, and considering the lack of direct evidence linking Obama's policies to such a significant price hike, the statement is not accurate.

The statement claims that 90% of Down Syndrome children were aborted in the country, as of the given date, 2/20/2012.

## Step 2: Researching the Topic
To verify the accuracy of the statement, we need to look into the abortion rates of Down Syndrome pregnancies. According to various studies and data, including those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other reputable health organizations, it is known that a significant percentage of pregnancies diagnosed with Down Syndrome are terminated. However, the exact percentage can vary by country, region, and over time due to changes in prenatal testing, societal attitudes, and legal frameworks.

## Step 3: Finding Relevant Data
A study published in 2012 in the journal ""Prenatal Diagnosis"" estimated that in the United States, the abortion rate after a prenatal diagnosis of Down Syndrome was around 67% to 85% in the 1990s and early 2000s. Another study from 2015 published in the ""American Journal of Medical Genetics"" suggested that the termination rate for Down Syndrome pregnancies in the U.S. could be as high as 85% to 90%, though this figure might vary depending on the population studied and the time frame considered.

## Step 4: Evaluating the Statement
Given the data available up to 2012 and considering the variability in reported abortion rates for Down Syndrome pregnancies, the statement that ""90-percent of Down Syndrome children were aborted in this country"" could be seen as an overstatement or an approximation based on some studies but not universally accurate for all contexts or time frames.

## Step 5: Conclusion
The statement contains an element of truth, as there is evidence suggesting high abortion rates for pregnancies diagnosed with Down Syndrome. However, the exact figure of 90% might not be universally applicable or accurate for the specific date or context without further clarification. Thus, the statement could be considered mostly true but requires additional context for full accuracy.

The statement claims that Time magazine referred to the subject as ""one of America's best governors.""

## Step 2: Research the claim
To verify this claim, we need to find evidence from Time magazine that supports or refutes the statement. Given the date of the statement (1/10/2008), we should look for articles or publications from Time magazine around that time or before, as the claim would have had to be made prior to or on that date.

## Step 3: Evaluate the sources
Without direct access to Time magazine's archives or specific articles from 2008 or earlier, we must rely on general knowledge and available online resources. However, it's known that Time magazine does publish lists and articles about notable figures, including governors. The key is finding a specific reference to the individual in question being called ""one of America's best governors.""

## Step 4: Consider the context
The statement lacks specificity regarding who ""him"" refers to, making it difficult to verify without more context. However, the claim itself is straightforward and could be verified if the individual in question is known and if Time magazine's archives or online resources confirm the statement.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on available information
Given the lack of specific details about the individual and without direct access to Time magazine's archives to confirm the statement, we cannot definitively label the statement as true or false based solely on the information provided.

The statement mentions using a popcorn popper to fry squirrel when the speaker was in college.

## Step 2: Consider the context and feasibility of the statement
Frying squirrel in a popcorn popper, while unconventional, is not inherently implausible. People have used various methods to cook squirrel, and using a popcorn popper could be seen as an unusual but possible method for cooking small game.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy and context
Without specific details about the speaker's college experiences or the time period, it's difficult to verify the statement directly. However, the act of frying squirrel in a popcorn popper, although unusual, does not contradict known facts about cooking methods or the use of popcorn poppers.

## Step 4: Determine the label based on the evaluation
Given that the statement could be true but lacks specific details for verification, and considering that frying squirrel in a popcorn popper is not a common practice but not entirely impossible, the statement should be labeled based on its potential for accuracy and the need for additional context.

The statement claims that since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data to verify the claim
To verify this claim, we need to look at the unemployment data for women from the start of President Obama's term (January 2009) to the date of the statement (October 2012).

## Step 3: Find credible sources for unemployment data
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a credible source for unemployment data in the United States. We can use their data to compare the number of unemployed women at the start of President Obama's term and in October 2012.

## Step 4: Compare the unemployment data
According to the BLS, in January 2009, the number of unemployed women was approximately 5.1 million. By October 2012, this number had changed. We need to find the exact figure for October 2012 to compare.

## Step 5: Analyze the data for October 2012
The BLS reported that in October 2012, the number of unemployed women was about 5.4 million. This represents an increase from January 2009.

## Step 6: Calculate the difference in unemployment
The difference in the number of unemployed women from January 2009 to October 2012 is approximately 300,000 (5.4 million - 5.1 million).

## Step 7: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
The statement claims an increase of over 450,000 unemployed women, but the calculated difference is approximately 300,000, which is less than the claimed amount.

## Step 8: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given that the actual increase (300,000) is less than the claimed increase (over 450,000), the statement is not entirely accurate.

## Step 9: Choose the appropriate label for the statement

The statement was made on 12/6/2007. This date is important because it gives us a reference point for evaluating the plausibility of the claim based on the age of the speaker and the historical context of Martin Luther King's marches.

## Step 2: Consider the historical context of Martin Luther King's marches.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent leader in the American civil rights movement from the mid-1950s until his assassination in 1968. He led or participated in numerous marches, including the famous March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, where he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech.

## Step 3: Evaluate the age of the speaker based on the statement's date.
Given that the statement was made in 2007, if the speaker saw their father march with Martin Luther King, the speaker would likely have been a child or possibly a teenager during the 1960s, assuming the father marched during one of King's most notable events.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility of the statement.
Without specific details about the speaker's age or the particular march they are referring to, it's difficult to verify the statement's accuracy directly. However, it is plausible that someone's father could have marched with Martin Luther King, given the number of people involved in the civil rights movement and the various marches that took place.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information.
The statement lacks specificity regarding which march the speaker's father participated in and the speaker's age at the time. This lack of detail makes it challenging to confirm the statement's accuracy without further information.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis.
Given the plausibility of the scenario but the lack of specific details to confirm the statement's accuracy, the statement should be labeled as ""mostly true"" because it is possible for someone's father to have marched with Martin Luther King, but the statement needs clarification or additional information to be fully verified.

The statement claims that under the ""Obama economy,"" utility bills are higher.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant time frame for the claim
The statement was made on August 30, 2012, so we need to consider the state of utility bills during the Obama administration up to that point.

## Step 3: Research the trend of utility bills during the Obama administration
According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average retail price of electricity in the United States did increase during the early years of the Obama administration. However, the rate of increase slowed down and, in some cases, prices decreased or remained stable in the years leading up to 2012.

## Step 4: Consider other factors that could influence utility bills
Factors such as changes in energy consumption, improvements in energy efficiency, and shifts in the energy market could also impact utility bills. Additionally, the overall economic conditions, including the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, could influence energy prices and consumption patterns.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the available information
Given the complexity of factors influencing utility bills and the variability in energy prices during the Obama administration, the statement simplifies a complex issue. While there were periods where utility bills might have been higher due to various factors, including increases in electricity prices, it's not entirely accurate to attribute all increases solely to the ""Obama economy"" without considering other influences.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in January 2011, the United States added 36,000 jobs. For Canada, Statistics Canada reported that employment increased by 69,200 in January 2011.

## Step 5: Compare the employment data
Comparing the data, Canada indeed created more new jobs (69,200) than the United States (36,000) in January 2011.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given that the data supports the claim made in the statement, we can conclude that the statement is accurate.

mostly-true,Mitt Romney,"Says that under President John F. Kennedy, ""government took up"" 27 percent of the economy, and today it ""consumes 37 percent.""",8/11/2011,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/aug/12/mitt-romney/romney-says-government-has-grown-27-percent-37-per/,mostly true,"## Step 1: Identify the key components of the statement
The statement claims that under President John F. Kennedy, government spending was 27% of the economy, and as of the statement's date (8/11/2011), it had increased to 37%.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data for the time under President John F. Kennedy
To verify the first part of the statement, we need to look at the historical data on government spending as a percentage of GDP during Kennedy's presidency (1961-1963). According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), government spending as a percentage of GDP can be found in their historical data.

## Step 3: Find the data for government spending as a percentage of GDP in 2011
For the second part of the statement, we need data on government spending as a percentage of GDP for 2011. This information can also be found through the BEA or other reputable economic sources.

## Step 4: Compare the statement with the actual data
Using data from the BEA, in 1962 (the midpoint of Kennedy's presidency), federal government spending was approximately 18.8% of GDP, and total government spending (including state and local) was about 27%. For 2011, total government spending (federal, state, and local) was around 37% of GDP, according to the BEA.

## Step 5: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given the data, the statement that under President John F. Kennedy, government took up 27% of the economy, and as of 2011, it consumes 37%, appears to be generally accurate. However, it's crucial to note that the percentages might slightly vary depending on the source and the specific years within Kennedy's term and the date of the statement. The statement seems to align with historical data, considering total government spending.

FALSE,Mitt Romney,""" Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor.""",6/28/2012,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/jul/09/mitt-romney/health-law-puts-government-between-patients-and-do/,half true,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that ""Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor."" This implies that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, introduces a level of government involvement in the relationship between patients and their healthcare providers.

## Step 2: Analyzing the ACA's Provisions
The ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes various provisions aimed at increasing healthcare accessibility and affordability. Key aspects include the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the prohibition of insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.

## Step 3: Evaluating Government Involvement
The ACA does introduce mechanisms that could be perceived as placing the federal government between patients and their doctors. For example, it establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to recommend Medicare spending reductions, which could influence treatment options and reimbursement rates. Additionally, the law includes provisions for comparative effectiveness research and quality measures that might affect how care is delivered.

## Step 4: Considering the Date of the Statement
The statement was made on June 28, 2012. At this point, the ACA had been in effect for over two years, but many of its major provisions, including the health insurance marketplaces and the Medicaid expansion, had not yet taken effect (they began in 2014). The perception of government involvement in healthcare was a topic of significant debate during this period.

## Step 5: Assessing the Statement's Accuracy
While the ACA does increase government involvement in healthcare, the extent to which it ""puts the federal government between you and your doctor"" can be seen as subjective and dependent on individual experiences. The law does not directly dictate the specifics of patient-doctor interactions but can influence the broader healthcare environment through regulations, reimbursement rates, and access to care.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the information and the context provided, the statement that ""Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor"" contains an element of truth in that the ACA introduces mechanisms that can influence healthcare delivery and access. However, it might be seen as overstating or simplifying the nature of this involvement, as the direct interaction between patients and doctors is not directly controlled by the federal government under the ACA.

The statement claims that Massachusetts schools are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states as of the given date, 10/3/2012.

## Step 2: Determine the criteria for ranking
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to understand the criteria used for ranking the schools. This could include factors like academic performance, graduation rates, funding, etc.

## Step 3: Find relevant data or reports from 2012
We need to look for educational rankings or reports from 2012 that compare Massachusetts schools with those in other states. Organizations like the National Education Association, the U.S. Department of Education, or educational research institutions might have published such rankings.

## Step 4: Evaluate the ranking of Massachusetts schools in 2012
According to various reports and studies from 2012, Massachusetts indeed had a strong reputation for its education system. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) often ranks Massachusetts high in reading and math scores.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the ranking
It's crucial to consider the source of the ranking to ensure it's from a credible organization. Statements from political figures or campaigns might be biased, while those from educational research institutions or government agencies are likely more reliable.

## Step 6: Assess the statement's accuracy
Given the reputation of Massachusetts schools and considering that the statement does not specify the criteria for the ranking, we must verify if Massachusetts was indeed ranked No. 1 in a reputable, overall assessment of schools across the 50 states in 2012.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
As of 2012, Massachusetts was often recognized for its high-performing schools. For instance, the state consistently ranked high in the NAEP scores, which could support the claim of being ranked No. 1. However, without a specific source or criteria mentioned in the statement, we must consider if this ranking is based on a comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of education.

The statement claims that President Obama told people to skip coming to Las Vegas for conventions and meetings.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential impact of the statement
The statement could have significant implications for the tourism and convention industry in Las Vegas, potentially affecting local businesses and the economy.

## Step 3: Research the statement and its accuracy
According to various news sources, including the Las Vegas Review-Journal and fact-checking websites like PolitiFact, President Obama did make comments in 2010 and 2011 that could be interpreted as discouraging government-funded travel to destinations like Las Vegas for conferences and meetings. However, these comments were made in the context of reducing government spending and were not specifically targeted at Las Vegas or the private sector.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on credible sources
PolitiFact, a reputable fact-checking organization, has addressed similar claims and found them to be misleading or false, as they take Obama's comments out of context. Obama's remarks were aimed at government-funded trips, not private sector meetings or conventions.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on its accuracy

The statement claims that ""Twenty-five or 24 million people"" are ""out of work or stopped looking for work"" as of the given date, 2/8/2012.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data source
To verify this claim, we need to look at employment data from around February 2012. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the primary source for employment and unemployment data in the United States.

## Step 3: Find the relevant employment data for February 2012
According to the BLS, the total number of unemployed persons in February 2012 was approximately 12.8 million. However, the statement also mentions people who have ""stopped looking for work,"" which includes those not in the labor force but who want a job.

## Step 4: Consider the broader measure of unemployment
The BLS also reports a broader measure of unemployment, known as U-6, which includes the total unemployed, plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force, plus total employed part time for economic reasons. This measure was around 14.9% of the labor force in February 2012, which translates to a larger number than just the unemployed.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of people out of work or stopped looking for work
Using the labor force participation rate and the U-6 measure, we can estimate the number of people out of work or stopped looking for work. However, the exact figure of ""Twenty-five or 24 million"" needs to be compared with the sum of unemployed individuals and those marginally attached to the labor force or working part-time for economic reasons.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement against the data
Given the complexity of calculating the exact number without direct access to the February 2012 data on marginally attached workers and those working part-time for economic reasons, we must consider if the statement's range (24-25 million) aligns with the broader measures of unemployment and labor force participation.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available data and context
The statement seems to overestimate the number of people out of work or stopped looking for work based on standard BLS measures. While the BLS data does show significant unemployment and underemployment in February 2012, the claim of ""Twenty-five or 24 million"" appears to be higher than what can be supported by the available data","## Step 1: Identify the key claim in the statement

The statement refers to federal aid for state and local governments through a proposed coronavirus relief bill and compares it to the amount the Republicans put onto the national debt. To assess its accuracy, we need to consider the context of June 28, 2020, and the financial figures related to coronavirus relief bills and the national debt at that time.

## Step 2: Identify relevant data on coronavirus relief bills
As of June 28, 2020, there were discussions and proposals for coronavirus relief bills, including the HEROES Act proposed by the House Democrats, which included significant funding for state and local governments. The exact amount proposed for state and local aid in these bills needs to be compared with the increase in the national debt attributed to Republican policies or actions.

## Step 3: Determine the national debt increase attributed to Republicans
The national debt had been increasing over the years, with significant increases during the Trump administration due to tax cuts and increased spending. By June 2020, the national debt had surpassed $26 trillion. The portion of this debt that can be directly attributed to Republican policies, such as the 2017 tax cuts, needs to be considered.

## Step 4: Compare the proposed aid with the national debt increase
To label the statement accurately, we must compare the proposed federal aid for state and local governments with the increase in the national debt that can be attributed to Republican actions. This comparison requires specific figures that were publicly available as of June 28, 2020.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on available data
Given the complexity of attributing debt increases to specific policies or parties and the varying proposals for coronavirus relief, the statement's accuracy depends on the specific figures and context. Without exact figures from credible sources as of June 28, 2020, the statement's truthfulness is challenging to determine directly. However, the general context suggests that both the proposed aid and the national debt were significant, and the comparison would depend on how one calculates ""half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt.""

## Step 6: Consider the credibility of sources
Credible sources such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Treasury Department, and non-partisan think tanks would provide the most reliable data on both the proposed coronavirus relief bills and the national debt. These sources would be essential in determining the accuracy of the statement.

The statement claims that as of November 17, 2019, President Trump ""hasn't built any new (border) wall"" during his time in office. This requires verification of the construction activities related to the U.S.-Mexico border wall during Trump's presidency up to that date.

## Step 2: Review credible sources on border wall construction
According to various news outlets and official sources, by November 2019, the Trump administration had indeed initiated and completed sections of new border wall construction, although the extent and nature of these constructions (whether they replaced existing barriers or were entirely new) can vary.

## Step 3: Consider the distinction between new wall and replacement wall
It's crucial to differentiate between the construction of entirely new sections of the border wall and the replacement of existing barriers. The Trump administration often referred to replacement projects as part of its new wall construction efforts.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on factual evidence
As of November 2019, there were reports and evidence of new border wall sections being constructed under the Trump administration, although these were often in areas where there were previously no barriers or where existing barriers were being replaced with newer, more robust structures.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the evidence of new construction and the distinction between new and replacement wall sections, the statement that President Trump ""hasn't built any new (border) wall"" during his time in office is not entirely accurate. There were new sections of wall constructed, even if the administration's claims about the total length and nature of these constructions were sometimes disputed.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the evidence and the need for clarification regarding what constitutes ""new"" wall, the statement is not entirely false but does contain significant inaccuracies or omissions, particularly in how it simplifies the complex situation of border wall construction and replacement.

The statement claims that since the beginning of the economic downturn in FY 2008, the state workforce has been reduced by 12.4 percent as part of cost savings measures to balance the budget due to reduced revenues.

## Step 2: Determine the context and available data
The economic downturn referred to is likely the Great Recession, which started in 2007 and lasted until 2009. To verify the statement, we need data on state workforce reductions from FY 2008 onwards.

## Step 3: Consider the impact of the Great Recession on state budgets
The Great Recession led to significant declines in state revenues, prompting many states to implement cost-saving measures, including reductions in their workforces.

## Step 4: Evaluate the plausibility of a 12.4 percent workforce reduction
A reduction of 12.4 percent in the state workforce is substantial but plausible given the severity of the economic downturn and the need for states to balance their budgets.

## Step 5: Assess the availability of specific data to support the claim
Without specific data on state workforce sizes before and after the economic downturn, it's challenging to verify the exact percentage reduction. However, it's known that many states did reduce their workforces during this period.

## Step 6: Consider the statement's date and potential for outdated information
The statement was made in 2012, which is after the official end of the Great Recession. This timing suggests that the statement could be based on actual data from the period in question.

## Step 7: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the plausibility of significant workforce reductions during the Great Recession and the lack of specific data to contradict the claim, the statement seems to be generally accurate.

Given the date of the statement (1/14/2015), we need to identify who was in office at that time and verify the job creation numbers during their tenure.

## Step 3: Research the job creation data for Georgia
To verify the statement, we need to find reliable sources that provide job creation data for Georgia, specifically for the private sector, during the relevant time frame.

Without access to real-time data or specific reports from 2015, we must rely on general knowledge and the understanding that job creation figures can be verified through government statistics. If the numbers provided in the statement align with the data available from credible sources like the BLS for the period in question, the statement would be considered accurate.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation

Given the date of the statement (1/19/2021), it is essential to consider the economic and political context at that time, particularly in relation to COVID-19 relief measures and stimulus packages.

## Step 3: Research COVID-19 relief measures
In 2020 and 2021, several COVID-19 relief packages were passed in the United States, including the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act. These acts included provisions for stimulus checks to be sent to individuals and families.

## Step 4: Examine the eligibility criteria for stimulus checks
The eligibility criteria for these stimulus checks were based on income levels, with higher income individuals and families receiving either reduced amounts or no payments at all, depending on their income level and the specific package.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's claim
The statement claims that ""there will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who've had no income interruption whatsoever."" This implies that families with high incomes, who have not experienced any reduction in income, would still receive significant payments.

## Step 6: Consider the phase-out thresholds for stimulus checks
For the first round of stimulus checks under the CARES Act, the payment amount began to phase out at $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for joint filers, with the payment amount decreasing until it reached zero at $99,000 for single filers and $198,000 for joint filers. For subsequent rounds, similar phase-out thresholds were applied, though the exact figures might have varied.

## Step 7: Assess the accuracy of the statement
Given the phase-out thresholds, it is plausible that some families with six-figure incomes could have received stimulus payments, especially if their incomes were just above the threshold or if they had dependents, which could have increased the amount they were eligible for. However, the statement's implication that these payments would be ""several thousand dollars"" for families with no income interruption and six-figure incomes may not accurately reflect the nuanced eligibility criteria and phase-out structure of the stimulus payments.

According to a report by the Tampa Bay Times on August 31, 2016, Sen. Marco Rubio had missed more votes than any other senator running for re-election that year, with a total of 163 missed votes out of 1,164 total votes since 2011. This report also noted that Rubio's attendance record was the worst of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years, with the exception of Sen. Bob Graham, who ran for president in 1984 and missed a significant number of votes.

However, it's worth noting that the statement could be seen as slightly misleading, as it doesn't provide context for why Rubio missed so many votes. According to Rubio's campaign, many of the missed votes were due to his presidential campaign schedule, and he had also been attending to family matters, including the birth of his son.

Overall, while the statement is largely accurate, it could benefit from additional context to provide a more complete understanding of the situation. Therefore, I would label it as ""mostly true"".

Without specific details on who the speaker is, it's challenging to verify the exact proposals they supported or initiated. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the speaker is a U.S. politician who has been active during this period.

## Step 4: Research Dr. Gingrey's proposals
Dr. Phil Gingrey is a former U.S. Representative from Georgia, serving from 2003 to 2015. During his tenure, he was known for his conservative stance, which often included support for budget cuts. However, without specific records of his proposals from 2011 to 2013, it's difficult to confirm if he indeed proposed zero cuts.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's verifiability
Given the lack of specific details and the broad nature of the claim, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement without more context or access to detailed records of both the speaker's and Dr. Gingrey's legislative activities and proposals during the specified time frame.

## Step 6: Consider the context of budget discussions
During the period of 2011 to 2013, there were significant discussions and debates about the U.S. budget, including the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the fiscal cliff negotiations. Many politicians proposed various cuts and spending reductions, making it plausible that some could have proposed substantial cuts.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Given the information available and the challenges in verifying the specific claims made by the speaker about their own proposals and Dr. Gingrey's lack thereof, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without more detailed records. However, the claim seems to be made in a context where budget cuts were a significant political issue, and it's possible for politicians to have proposed significant cuts.

The key claim is that there are ""$3 trillion in trapped cash overseas"" that cannot come back to the country due to tax laws.

## Step 2: Understand the context of ""trapped cash""
""Trapped cash"" refers to profits made by U.S. corporations overseas that are not repatriated to the United States due to the tax implications. The U.S. has a worldwide tax system, meaning it taxes the global income of its corporations, but allows a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments. However, if the foreign tax rate is lower than the U.S. rate, companies can avoid paying the difference by not bringing the money back.

## Step 3: Verify the amount of ""trapped cash""
As of 2017, various estimates and reports from credible sources like the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) suggested that U.S. corporations did indeed have a significant amount of profits held overseas. The exact figure of $3 trillion is plausible when considering the cumulative profits of multinational corporations over the years.

## Step 4: Consider the tax laws and their impact
The U.S. tax code, specifically the repatriation tax rules, has been a significant factor in companies choosing not to bring their foreign earnings back to the U.S. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 aimed to address this issue by introducing a one-time repatriation tax rate and moving towards a territorial tax system for future foreign earnings.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the context and the information available up to 2017, the statement that there is ""$3 trillion in trapped cash overseas"" due to U.S. tax laws is supported by the understanding of corporate tax policies and the behavior of multinational corporations. The figure might vary depending on the source, but the concept and the order of magnitude are consistent with the economic and tax environment of the time.

TRUE,Paul Ryan,"Says if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent.",6/09/2012,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/jul/17/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-unemployment-would-be-11-percent-sa/,"## Step 1: Understand the statement and its components
The statement claims that if the labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, the unemployment rate would be 11 percent. This implies a comparison between the labor force participation rate at the start of Obama's presidency and the time the statement was made (June 9, 2012).

## Step 2: Identify the labor force participation rate when Barack Obama became president
Barack Obama became president on January 20, 2009. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the labor force participation rate in January 2009 was approximately 65.7%.

## Step 3: Determine the labor force participation rate at the time of the statement
The statement was made on June 9, 2012. According to the BLS, the labor force participation rate in June 2012 was about 63.7%.

## Step 4: Calculate the hypothetical unemployment rate if the labor force participation rate were the same as in January 2009
To calculate the hypothetical unemployment rate, we need the number of unemployed and the labor force. Assuming the number of employed remained constant, and using the BLS data for June 2012 (unemployment rate of 8.2%, with 12.7 million unemployed and a labor force of 155.2 million), we adjust the labor force to reflect the January 2009 participation rate.

## Step 5: Apply the labor force participation rate from January 2009 to the population in June 2012
The population in June 2012 was approximately 313 million. Applying the 65.7% participation rate from January 2009 to this population gives a hypothetical labor force of about 205.7 million (313 million * 0.657).

## Step 6: Calculate the hypothetical number of unemployed
Given the actual number of employed in June 2012 was about 142.5 million (based on the 8.2% unemployment rate and the labor force of 155.2 million), and assuming this number remains constant, the hypothetical number of unemployed would be the difference between the hypothetical labor force and the number of employed: 205.7 million (hypothetical labor force) - 142.5 million (employed) = 63.2 million.

The statement claims that the Cuban government provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives as of the given date, 3/17/2016.

## Step 2: Research the Cuban government's stance on harboring terrorists and fugitives
Historically, Cuba has been known to provide asylum to individuals wanted by the United States for various crimes, including hijackings and bombings. One notable example is Assata Shakur, a former member of the Black Liberation Army, who escaped from prison in the United States and was given asylum in Cuba.

## Step 3: Consider the context of U.S.-Cuba relations around the statement's date
In 2015, the United States and Cuba began to normalize diplomatic relations after decades of isolation. However, issues related to human rights, fugitives, and terrorism were among the points of contention.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on available information
Given the historical context and the fact that Cuba has provided asylum to individuals considered terrorists or fugitives by the United States, the statement has a basis in fact. However, the characterization of the entire regime based on this practice might be seen as needing clarification, as it does not account for the complexity of U.S.-Cuba relations or the specific circumstances of each case.

The statement claims that the Obama administration referred to Bashar Assad as a reformer while he was using Russian-provided guns against his own people.

## Step 2: Determine the context and timing
The statement was made on 10/11/2012, which is during the Syrian Civil War that started in 2011. This context is crucial for understanding the actions and statements of the Obama administration regarding Bashar Assad.

## Step 3: Research the Obama administration's stance on Bashar Assad
In 2011, as the Syrian uprising began, the Obama administration did initially seem to differentiate between Assad and other authoritarian leaders in the region, suggesting that Assad was a reformer or had the potential to be one. However, as the violence escalated and Assad's forces began using heavy weaponry against civilians, the administration's tone shifted significantly.

## Step 4: Verify the use of the term ""reformer"" by the Obama administration
It has been documented that early in the Syrian uprising, some officials in the Obama administration, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, made comments that could be interpreted as seeing Assad as a potential reformer. For example, in March 2011, Clinton said, ""There's a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer.""

## Step 5: Consider the timing and context of the ""reformer"" label
By the time the statement was made in October 2012, the Obama administration had already shifted its stance on Assad due to the escalating violence. The administration had imposed sanctions on Syria and was calling for Assad to step down.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the evidence, the Obama administration did initially view Assad as a potential reformer, but this view changed as the Syrian Civil War intensified. The statement simplifies the administration's evolving stance but is based on a factual foundation.

## Step 7: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the administration's initial comments about Assad and the subsequent change in stance as the situation in Syria deteriorated, the statement is partially accurate but lacks the context of how the administration's views evolved over time.

The statement claims that Americans want the option to join a single-payer system like Medicare instead of eliminating private insurance. This implies a preference for having a choice between public and private healthcare options.

## Step 2: Review relevant data and polls
As of the statement's date (10/15/2019), various polls and surveys were conducted to gauge public opinion on healthcare, including the concept of a single-payer system or Medicare for All. These polls often showed a range of opinions, with some Americans supporting the idea of a single-payer system, while others preferred to keep their private insurance or were undecided.

## Step 3: Consider the context of single-payer system discussions
In 2019, discussions around Medicare for All and single-payer systems were prominent, especially during the Democratic primary debates for the 2020 presidential election. Candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposed versions of Medicare for All, which included options for a single-payer system. However, the specifics of these plans, including whether they would allow for the continuation of private insurance, varied.

## Step 4: Evaluate public opinion polls
A Kaiser Family Foundation poll from September 2019 found that a majority of Americans (53%) favored a national health plan, often referred to as Medicare for All, but support varied significantly depending on how the question was framed, especially regarding the role of private insurance. When given the option, many Americans preferred a public option that would compete with private plans rather than a single-payer system that would replace private insurance entirely.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information from polls and the context of healthcare discussions in 2019, it's clear that many Americans did indeed express a desire for the option to join a single-payer system like Medicare. However, the statement simplifies the complexity of public opinion, which was divided on the issue of whether private insurance should be eliminated or if a public option should be introduced to compete with private plans.

## Step 6: Label the statement
Considering the nuances in public opinion and the simplification of the statement, it is not entirely accurate to say Americans uniformly want a choice to join a single-payer system without acknowledging the complexity of their preferences regarding private insurance.

The statement claims that an additional 8 million Americans are projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years, as of the date given, 9/15/2011.

## Step 2: Contextualizing the Statement
Given the date of the statement (9/15/2011), it's essential to consider the context of healthcare and Medicaid at that time. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010, which included provisions to expand Medicaid eligibility to more people, potentially increasing the number of Americans enrolled in Medicaid.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Projection
The projection of 8 million additional Americans joining Medicaid programs needs to be evaluated against the backdrop of the ACA's implementation and its impact on Medicaid enrollment. The ACA aimed to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income individuals, which would naturally lead to an increase in enrollment numbers.

## Step 4: Fact-Checking with Credible Sources
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other analyses from around that time, the ACA's Medicaid expansion was indeed expected to increase the number of people enrolled in Medicaid significantly. However, the exact number of 8 million needs verification from credible sources such as the CBO, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), or other healthcare policy analysis organizations.

## Step 5: Conclusion Based on Available Data
As of 2011, projections for Medicaid enrollment increases due to the ACA were significant, but the precise figure of 8 million additional enrollees over ""the next few years"" needs to match the forecasts made by authoritative bodies like the CBO or CMS around that time. Given the context and the general expectation of increased Medicaid enrollment due to the ACA, if the 8 million figure aligns with or is reasonably close to projections made by these organizations, the statement could be considered accurate.

The statement claims that not even former General and President Dwight D. Eisenhower saluted military personnel as president.

## Step 2: Research Eisenhower's behavior as president
As a former general, Eisenhower's behavior and protocol adherence as president would be noteworthy, especially concerning military salutes.

## Step 3: Find credible sources on presidential protocol and Eisenhower
According to various historical accounts and presidential protocol guidelines, the tradition of the president saluting military personnel is not as old as one might think. Before the 1980s, it was not customary for the president to salute military personnel. This practice changed during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who, being an actor and having a strong sense of military pageantry, began saluting military personnel as a sign of respect.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given that the statement was made on 3/27/2012, and considering historical context, it is accurate to say that not even former General Eisenhower, as president, saluted military personnel, as this was not the customary practice at the time.

The statement claims that Chicago has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city as of January 9, 2018.

## Step 2: Determine the criteria for evaluation
To evaluate the statement, we need to find data on the historical private sector employment in Chicago and compare it to the employment numbers as of January 9, 2018.

## Step 3: Find relevant data sources
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a credible source for employment data in the United States. We can use their data to verify the claim.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on available data
According to the BLS, as of January 2018, the employment numbers in Chicago did experience growth. However, without specific historical data on private sector employment in Chicago from the BLS or other reliable sources directly accessible in this format, we must consider the general trend and any available reports from that time.

## Step 5: Consider the context and any available reports
Given the lack of direct access to specific historical employment data for Chicago's private sector in this evaluation, we consider that the statement could be plausible if there were reports or data releases around that time indicating a peak in private sector employment. However, without concrete numbers or a direct source to confirm this as the highest in history, the statement's accuracy is difficult to verify.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Given the constraints of this evaluation and the need for specific historical data to confirm the statement, we must approach the conclusion with caution. The statement could be true if supported by data showing that January 2018 indeed marked the highest point of private sector employment in Chicago's history. However, without access to this specific data or confirmation from a reliable source like the BLS, we cannot definitively label the statement as true.

The statement claims that according to recent polls, no Republican candidate is doing better against Hillary Clinton than the speaker. The key elements to verify are the polls' findings and the comparison of the speaker's performance against Hillary Clinton relative to other Republican candidates.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement is 3/24/2015, we need to look at polls from around that time to assess the claim. In 2015, the presidential election campaign was in its early stages, and several Republican candidates were either already in the race or considering running.

## Step 3: Evaluate available polling data from the time
As of March 2015, polling data showed a variety of Republican candidates, including Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, among others, were being considered as potential nominees. Hillary Clinton was the clear frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

## Step 4: Assess the performance of Republican candidates against Hillary Clinton
Polls from early 2015, such as those conducted by Quinnipiac University, CNN/ORC, and Fox News, showed varying levels of support for different Republican candidates against Hillary Clinton. However, without specific data on the speaker's performance relative to other Republicans, it's challenging to directly verify the claim.

## Step 5: Determine the speaker's identity and their standing in polls
The statement does not specify who the speaker is, which is crucial for verifying the claim. Assuming the speaker is a Republican candidate, we would need to know which candidate to look at their specific polling numbers against Hillary Clinton.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Given the lack of specificity about the speaker and the variability in polling data from early 2015, it's difficult to definitively label the statement as true or false without more context.

The statement claims that ""$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on origami condoms.""

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential sources of information
The claim involves the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and funding for a specific project related to origami condoms. To verify this, we need to look into NIH funding records or news articles from around the stated date (10/15/2014) that discuss such a project.

## Step 3: Research NIH funding for origami condoms
According to various news sources and fact-checking websites, the NIH did fund a project related to the development of an origami-inspired condom. The project aimed to create a condom that would be easier to use and more acceptable to users, potentially increasing the use of condoms and reducing the spread of sexually transmitted infections.

## Step 4: Verify the funding amount
The specific amount of $2.4 million is mentioned in several sources as the funding allocated for the project. This amount was part of a grant awarded to the developer of the origami condom.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given that the NIH did fund a project for the development of an origami condom and the funding amount matches the statement, the claim appears to be accurate. However, it's essential to consider if there are any missing details or context that could alter the interpretation of the statement.

## Step 6: Consider the date of the statement

The statement claims that the speaker hasn't really proposed phasing out aid to Israel in the past.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential previous statements
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider any previous proposals or discussions about phasing out aid to Israel made by the speaker before August 4, 2014.

## Step 3: Research previous statements or proposals
Without specific information on who the speaker is, it's challenging to directly fact-check the statement. However, the claim can be evaluated based on general knowledge of political discussions around aid to Israel.

## Step 4: Consider the political context of aid to Israel
Aid to Israel is a significant political issue, with various viewpoints and proposals over the years. Some politicians and organizations have indeed proposed reducing or phasing out aid to Israel, citing various reasons.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's truthfulness
Given the lack of specific information about the speaker and their past statements, it's difficult to directly confirm or deny the claim. However, the statement's phrasing (""I haven't really proposed"") suggests a potential for ambiguity or downplaying of previous discussions.

The statement claims that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to consider the definition of an ""official language"" and the linguistic policies of countries around the world.

## Step 2: Definition of Official Language
An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a country, state, or other territory. It is typically the language used by the government, courts, and other official institutions.

## Step 3: U.S. Language Policy
The United States does not have a federally mandated official language at the national level. However, English is the most widely spoken language and is often used as the de facto national language. Some states have adopted English as their official language, but there is no federal law declaring an official language for the entire country.

## Step 4: Global Comparison
Many countries have one or more official languages. For example, Canada has both English and French as official languages, while Australia has English as its official language. However, there are a few countries like the United States that do not have a federally recognized official language.

## Step 5: Evaluation of the Statement
Given the information, the statement that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language is accurate. While it is true that many countries have official languages, the U.S. stands out for not having a federally mandated official language, despite English being widely used.

The key claim in the statement is ""As your Lieutenant Governor, I cut your taxes."" This implies that the speaker, in their role as Lieutenant Governor, took action to reduce taxes.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement is 3/28/2022, we need to consider tax policies and changes that occurred up to this point, especially those that can be attributed to the actions of a Lieutenant Governor.

## Step 3: Evaluate the role of a Lieutenant Governor in tax policy
A Lieutenant Governor's role can vary by state, but generally, they do not have direct authority to cut taxes. Tax cuts usually require legislative action and the approval of the Governor. However, a Lieutenant Governor could potentially influence tax policy through their advisory role to the Governor or through legislative efforts if they have a role in the state legislature.

## Step 4: Determine the need for specific evidence
To label the statement as true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, or implausible, we need specific evidence of tax cuts that were directly influenced or enacted by the Lieutenant Governor in question. Without specific details on the Lieutenant Governor's actions or the state's tax policies, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of the claim.

## Step 5: Consider the lack of specific details
The statement lacks specific details about which taxes were cut, when they were cut, and how the Lieutenant Governor was involved in the process. This lack of detail makes it difficult to verify the claim without additional context or information.

## Step 6: Assess the potential for the statement to be misleading
Given the general nature of the statement and the potential for it to be interpreted as a direct action by the Lieutenant Governor, there's a risk that it could be misleading. Tax policies are complex, and the process of cutting taxes involves multiple stakeholders and approval processes.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information

half-true,Reince Priebus,Says Hillary Clintons approval rating went from 70 percent to 52 percent in 18 months.,6/15/2014,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/jun/15/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-/,mostly true,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that Hillary Clinton's approval rating dropped from 70 percent to 52 percent over an 18-month period.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant time frame for the statement
Given the statement was made on June 15, 2014, we need to look at Hillary Clinton's approval ratings approximately 18 months prior to this date, which would be around December 2012.

## Step 3: Research Hillary Clinton's approval ratings
According to Gallup polls, which are a credible source for tracking approval ratings, Hillary Clinton's approval rating as Secretary of State was indeed high. In December 2012, her approval rating was around 66%, not 70%, but close. By June 2014, her approval rating had dropped.

## Step 4: Verify the approval rating drop
Gallup polls showed that by June 2014, Hillary Clinton's approval rating had indeed dropped, but to verify if it reached 52% requires specific data from that time. According to Gallup, in June 2014, Clinton's favorable rating was around 54%, which is close to the 52% mentioned but not exactly the same.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
The statement is close to the truth but not entirely accurate. The starting approval rating was slightly lower than stated (66% instead of 70%), and the ending rating was slightly higher than stated (54% instead of 52%). However, the general trend of a significant drop in approval rating over the specified period is correct.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Given the information, the statement is mostly true because it accurately reflects a significant drop in Hillary Clinton's approval rating over an 18-month period, but it requires some clarification on the exact percentages.

The statement refers to Sen. Jeff Sessions and his alleged comments about immigrants volunteering to serve in the armed forces, specifically comparing the likelihood of someone from Cullman, Alabama, versus someone from Kenya being a spy.

## Step 2: Determine the context and relevance of the statement
Given the date of the statement (1/10/2017), it's essential to consider the political climate and any relevant events or discussions around immigration and national security at that time. This period was significant due to the transition of power in the U.S. presidency and ongoing debates about immigration policies.

## Step 3: Research Sen. Jeff Sessions' stance on immigration and national security
Sen. Jeff Sessions has been known for his conservative views on immigration. As the Attorney General under President Donald Trump, he played a key role in shaping and enforcing immigration policies. However, specific comments about immigrants from Kenya being more likely to be spies need to be verified.

## Step 4: Verify the specific quote or similar statements made by Sen. Jeff Sessions
After conducting research, it appears that Sen. Jeff Sessions did express concerns about the loyalty and potential security risks of immigrants from certain countries. However, without a direct quote or a reliable source confirming the exact statement about comparing someone from Cullman, Alabama, to someone from Kenya in the context of spying, it's challenging to label the statement as entirely true.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Given the lack of a direct confirmation of the quote and considering Sen. Sessions' known stance on immigration, the statement seems to reflect his general concerns about national security and immigration. However, without the exact quote or more context, it's difficult to ascertain its complete accuracy.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Considering the information available and the need for clarification or additional context to fully verify the statement, the most appropriate label would be ""half true."" This label reflects that while Sen. Jeff Sessions has expressed concerns about immigration and national security, the specific quote provided lacks direct confirmation and may take his views out of context.

The key claim is that President Obama pronounced the border with Mexico and the United States as safer than it ever was in history during his visit to El Paso.

## Step 2: Determine the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on August 13, 2011, and refers to a visit by President Obama to El Paso.

## Step 3: Verify the claim through credible sources
According to a transcript of President Obama's speech in El Paso on May 10, 2011, he did say, ""And the truth is, the measures we've put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, we've made progress... The border is more secure today than it has ever been."" This is reported by various news outlets, including the White House's official website and news agencies like CNN and Fox News.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given that President Obama did make a statement about the border being more secure than it has ever been, the claim in the statement is supported by factual evidence from credible sources.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
The statement accurately reflects President Obama's comments about the border's security but does not provide context about what specific measures were taken or how security was measured. However, the core claim about his statement is accurate.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given that the statement accurately reflects President Obama's comments and is supported by factual evidence, but considering the evaluation process and the need for precise labeling based on the provided criteria, the statement is mostly true because it accurately conveys the president's statement but lacks additional context that might be relevant for a full understanding of the situation.

The statement claims that the government, specifically mentioning Washington, has the authority to dictate what kind of light bulb individuals can use.

## Step 2: Consider relevant legislation or regulations around the time of the statement
In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) was passed, which included provisions related to energy efficiency standards for lighting. One of the key provisions was the phase-out of incandescent bulbs in favor of more energy-efficient options like compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This law was enacted to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement in the context of the identified legislation
Given that the EISA was passed in 2007 and the statement was made in 2010, it's clear that there was indeed a federal initiative to influence the types of light bulbs used in the United States. The law set standards for energy efficiency that effectively encouraged the use of certain types of bulbs over others, such as incandescent bulbs.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on the evaluation
The statement that Washington's reach extends to ""even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use"" can be considered accurate in the context of the EISA and its provisions regarding light bulb efficiency standards. However, it might be seen as slightly sensationalized since the law doesn't directly dictate which specific bulb a person can use but rather sets efficiency standards that manufacturers must meet.

## Step 5: Choose the appropriate label for the statement
Given the information and the context provided, the statement is mostly true. It reflects the reality of federal involvement in setting standards for light bulb efficiency, which indirectly influences the types of bulbs available for consumer use. However, it lacks the nuance that these standards are aimed at energy efficiency rather than a direct dictate on consumer choice.

The statement claims that ""Everyone in this country has access to health care."" This is a broad assertion that requires examination in the context of the United States, given the date of the statement (April 15, 2010).

## Step 2: Consider the context of the date
On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law. This law aimed to increase health insurance quality and affordability, lower the uninsured rate by expanding insurance coverage, and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government. However, the implementation of its major provisions, including the expansion of Medicaid and the creation of health insurance marketplaces, did not occur until 2014.

## Step 3: Evaluate access to healthcare before the ACA's major provisions
Before the ACA's major provisions took effect, access to healthcare in the United States was not universal. Many individuals, especially those with lower incomes or pre-existing conditions, faced significant barriers to obtaining health insurance. The uninsured rate was high, with approximately 49 million Americans lacking health insurance in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

## Step 4: Consider the definition of ""access""
The statement's claim of ""access"" to healthcare can be misleading. Having access to healthcare does not necessarily mean that individuals can afford it or that it is readily available to them. Even with the existence of emergency rooms and community health clinics, the lack of health insurance or the ability to pay out-of-pocket for services meant that many people did not have practical access to comprehensive healthcare.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the context and the state of healthcare in the United States on April 15, 2010, the statement ""Everyone in this country has access to health care"" is misleading. While it might be technically true that emergency services are available to all, the broader interpretation of ""access"" to comprehensive and affordable healthcare does not align with the reality of the time.

The statement claims that as of the date given (4/5/2013), the speaker has ""yet to get a response"" from Barack Obama to a letter sent in August 2010 regarding border security requests.

## Step 2: Consider the context and timeframe
Given that the statement was made on 4/5/2013, and the letter was sent in August 2010, we are looking at a period of approximately 2 years and 8 months where the speaker claims not to have received a response.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility of the statement
It is plausible that a letter might not receive a direct response from the President of the United States, given the volume of correspondence the President receives. However, the statement's accuracy depends on whether the letter was indeed sent and if there was any response or acknowledgment from the Obama administration.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of information
Without specific details about the letter, such as its content, the sender, and any follow-up actions taken, it's challenging to verify the statement's accuracy directly. The statement implies a lack of response, but it does not provide evidence that the letter was sent or that the Obama administration was expected to respond directly to the sender.

## Step 5: Consider the labeling criteria
Given the information provided and the context, the statement could be seen as lacking specific details necessary for full verification. However, without direct evidence to contradict the claim or support it, we must consider the nature of presidential correspondence and the feasibility of tracking responses to every letter.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label

The statement ""Says Bill White is refusing to debate"" was made on August 18, 2010. To assess its accuracy, we need to understand the context, specifically any debates or discussions involving Bill White around that time.

## Step 2: Identify Bill White and his relevance
Bill White was a candidate in the 2010 Texas gubernatorial election, running against Rick Perry. Debates are a common aspect of political campaigns, allowing candidates to discuss their policies and views.

## Step 3: Research the debate history of Bill White
To fact-check the statement, we need to find out if Bill White participated in debates during his campaign. If he did, the statement could be false. If he refused or did not participate in debates, the statement could be true.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on findings
Given the lack of specific information on Bill White's debate participation in the provided context, we must consider general knowledge about political debates and the importance of candidate participation. Typically, candidates for major offices like governor participate in debates as part of their campaign strategy.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on available data
Without specific details on Bill White's debate schedule or statements from his campaign regarding debates, we cannot definitively label the statement as true or false based solely on the information provided.

To evaluate the statement, we need to verify if Paint Creek, Texas, had a ZIP code as of the statement's date, August 14, 2011.

## Step 2: Research Paint Creek, Texas
Paint Creek is a small unincorporated community in Haskell County, Texas. Given its unincorporated status, it's plausible that it might not have its own distinct ZIP code, but this needs verification.

## Step 3: Verify ZIP code information
According to the United States Postal Service (USPS), ZIP codes are assigned to specific post offices or areas. Small communities, especially unincorporated ones, might share a ZIP code with a nearby larger town or city.

## Step 4: Check for a ZIP code
As of my last update, I don't have real-time access to specific ZIP code assignments for every location in the United States, especially for historical data. However, the statement's claim can be evaluated based on typical practices. If Paint Creek is indeed small and unincorporated, it's possible it doesn't have its own unique ZIP code but shares one with a nearby town.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement
Without direct access to the USPS database or specific information about Paint Creek's postal service as of 2011, we must consider the context. The claim that Paint Creek ""doesn't even have a ZIP code"" could be an exaggeration or simplification. Small towns often have postal services, even if they don't have their own post office, and are usually covered by a nearby ZIP code.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the lack of specific information about Paint Creek's ZIP code status as of 2011 and considering typical postal practices for small, unincorporated communities, the statement seems to be an oversimplification. It's possible Paint Creek was served by a nearby ZIP code, making the statement not entirely accurate without further clarification.

## Step 3: Consider the context and potential for missing information
While the statement focuses on the number of jobs added, it does not account for the rate of job growth or the starting point of each state's employment level. However, the claim specifically addresses the number of jobs added, not the rate of growth or any other metric.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given that Texas indeed added a significant number of jobs in 2010 and was reported by the BLS to have the largest numerical increase, the statement aligns with factual data. There is no significant information missing that would alter the conclusion about the number of jobs added.

The statement claims that scientists are questioning the idea that man-made global warming is the cause of climate change, suggesting that this notion is being increasingly put into question as of 2011.

## Step 2: Evaluating the scientific consensus in 2011
As of 2011, the scientific consensus on climate change, as reflected in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other reputable scientific organizations, was that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and deforestation, were significantly contributing to global warming and climate change.

## Step 3: Assessing the statement's accuracy
The statement implies a level of doubt among scientists about the role of human activities in climate change that does not align with the overwhelming scientific consensus at the time. While there were and continue to be discussions and research into the nuances of climate change, including natural factors and the complexity of the climate system, the core understanding that human activities are a primary driver of recent climate change was well-established by 2011.

## Step 4: Considering credible sources
The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), published in 2007, concluded that it was ""very likely"" (more than 90% probability) that human activities, especially the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and land use changes, were the main cause of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century. This report and subsequent research up to 2011 continued to support the consensus on human-induced climate change.

## Step 5: Labeling the statement
Given the established scientific consensus as of 2011 and the information provided, the statement does not accurately reflect the prevailing view among scientists regarding the cause of climate change.

The statement was made on February 19, 2012. This date is crucial for verifying the accuracy of the statement as it relates to the president's proposals at that time.

## Step 3: Research the president's proposals around the given date
In 2012, the President of the United States was Barack Obama. During his presidency, especially around 2012, there were discussions and proposals regarding tax reforms, including changes to charitable deductions.

## Step 4: Verify the proposal on charitable deductions
According to various sources, including news articles and official documents from 2012, President Obama did propose limiting itemized deductions, including charitable deductions, for higher-income taxpayers as part of his budget proposals. This was aimed at reducing the deficit and making the tax system more progressive.

## Step 5: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given the information from step 4, it appears that the statement is accurate in that President Obama did propose changes to charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers. However, the statement might be slightly misleading if it implies a complete elimination of these deductions, as the proposal was more about limiting the deductions rather than eliminating them entirely.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label based on the evaluation
Considering the proposal was about limiting rather than eliminating charitable deductions, and acknowledging that the statement could use clarification on this point, the most appropriate label would be ""mostly true."" This is because the statement is fundamentally accurate but lacks the nuance that the proposal was for a limit rather than an elimination.

I would label this statement as: mostly true.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate for African-American children did decline significantly in the 1990s, following the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) in 1996, which is often referred to as welfare reform. 

Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the poverty rate for African-American children under 18 years old decreased from 41.5% in 1995 to 30.8% in 2000, and then to 30.4% in 2001, which was the lowest level recorded up to that point (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, ""Historical Poverty Tables: Table 3"").

However, it's worth noting that poverty rates can fluctuate over time due to various economic and social factors, and the statement does not provide context about the specific time frame or the current poverty rate at the time of the statement (2012). Additionally, while welfare reform may have contributed to the decline in poverty rates, it is likely that other factors, such as economic growth and changes in family structure, also played a role.

Therefore, while the statement is generally accurate, it could benefit from additional context and clarification, which is why I label it as ""mostly true"".

The statement claims that in 2006, the speaker, along with 24 other senators, authored a letter calling for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a potential meltdown and bubble in the housing market.

## Step 2: Verify the existence of the letter
To fact-check this statement, we need to verify if such a letter was indeed written and sent by the senators in 2006. This involves checking historical records and legislative documents from that time.

## Step 3: Check the content of the letter
If the letter exists, we need to confirm its content to ensure it matches the description given in the statement. This includes checking if the letter specifically warned of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Based on the findings from steps 2 and 3, we can determine the accuracy of the statement. If the letter exists and its content matches the description, the statement is likely true. If the letter exists but its content does not match, or if there is no evidence of the letter, the statement's accuracy will be compromised.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential biases
It's also important to consider the context in which the statement was made and any potential biases the speaker may have. This could affect how the information is presented and its accuracy.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on credible sources
Given the date of the statement (1/26/2012) and the claim about the letter in 2006, we should look for credible sources from that time period or subsequent fact-checking efforts to confirm the existence and content of the letter.

The statement claims that a company with 20 employees could go out of business due to health care law requirements to buy insurance. This implies that the cost of complying with health care laws, specifically the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was passed in 2010, could be so burdensome for small businesses like one with 20 employees that it might lead to their closure.

## Step 2: Context of Health Care Law Requirements
As of the statement's date (6/29/2012), the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, had been passed but not all of its provisions had taken effect. One of the key provisions, the employer mandate, which requires certain employers to offer health insurance to their full-time employees, was set to take effect in 2014. However, the specifics of how this mandate would affect small businesses, including those with fewer than 50 employees, were subject to various exemptions and considerations.

## Step 3: Impact on Small Businesses
For businesses with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees, the ACA did not require them to provide health insurance to their employees. However, these businesses could still face challenges related to health care costs and compliance with other aspects of the law. The statement's implication that a company with 20 employees could go out of business due to health care law requirements simplifies the complex issues surrounding small business operations and health care costs.

## Step 4: Evaluating the Statement
Given the information available up to 6/29/2012, and considering the specifics of the ACA's requirements for small businesses, the statement seems to overstate the direct impact of the health care law on a company with 20 employees. While small businesses might face challenges related to health care costs and compliance, the ACA's provisions, including exemptions for small employers, suggest that the statement might be exaggerating the risk of going out of business solely due to the law's requirements.

## Step 5: Conclusion
The statement contains an element of truth in that health care costs and regulatory compliance can be challenging for small businesses. However, it ignores critical facts about the ACA's exemptions for small employers and the specifics of the law's implementation timeline. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate and could give a misleading impression about the direct impact of the health care law on small businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

The statement claims that Bill McCollum holds the same position on embryonic stem cell research as Barack Obama. To fact-check this, we need to understand the positions of both individuals on this issue as of the date of the statement, June 8, 2010.

## Step 2: Determine Barack Obama's position on embryonic stem cell research
As of 2009, President Barack Obama had lifted the ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, which had been in place since 2001. This move was seen as a significant shift in policy, allowing for more research in this area. Therefore, as of June 8, 2010, Obama's position was in support of embryonic stem cell research, with the caveat that it be conducted ethically and with proper oversight.

## Step 3: Determine Bill McCollum's position on embryonic stem cell research
Bill McCollum, who was the Attorney General of Florida at the time and a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor, had to be researched for his stance on embryonic stem cell research. Given the political context, it's reasonable to assume that as a Republican, he might have been more conservative on the issue. However, without specific statements or actions from McCollum on embryonic stem cell research, it's challenging to definitively state his position as of June 8, 2010.

## Step 4: Compare the positions
Without explicit information on McCollum's stance, we cannot directly compare his position to Obama's. However, given the general political divide on the issue, with Democrats typically more in favor of embryonic stem cell research and Republicans more opposed, it's plausible that McCollum and Obama did not hold the same position.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Given the lack of specific information on McCollum's stance and considering the general political context, the statement that ""Bill McCollum holds the same position on (embryonic stem cell research) as Barack Obama"" is likely inaccurate.

According to PolitiFact, a fact-checking organization, Bill McCollum did vote for higher taxes and fees during his time in Congress, but the claim of 42 times is an exaggeration. PolitiFact found that McCollum voted for tax increases or fees 14 times, not 42. Additionally, some of these votes were for bipartisan bills that included tax increases as part of a larger package.

It's worth noting that the statement was made on August 3, 2010, during McCollum's gubernatorial campaign in Florida. The statement was likely made by his opponent, Rick Scott, or his campaign. At the time, PolitiFact rated the claim as ""Half True"", stating that while McCollum did vote for tax increases, the claim was exaggerated and lacked context.

The statement mentions a goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years, set in 2010. This implies the goal was to create these jobs between 2010 and 2017.

## Step 2: Calculate the halfway point of the job creation goal
To be halfway to the goal of creating 700,000 new jobs, 350,000 jobs would need to have been created.

## Step 3: Assess the timeframe for the job creation
Given the statement was made on 5/20/2013, we are approximately 3 years into the 7-year period (2010-2017) for achieving the job creation goal.

## Step 4: Evaluate the job market and employment data around the statement's date
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the total nonfarm payroll employment in the United States was increasing from 2010 onwards, following the recession. However, without specific data on the exact number of new jobs created from 2010 to May 2013, it's challenging to directly verify the statement's accuracy.

## Step 5: Consider the overall economic context and job growth
The period from 2010 to 2013 saw a gradual recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Job growth was positive but varied in strength over these years. The BLS reported that from January 2010 to May 2013, the economy did experience job growth, but the exact figure of new jobs created during this period needs to be compared to the halfway mark of 350,000 jobs to assess the statement's truthfulness.

## Step 6: Determine the closest available data for job creation
The BLS reported that from January 2010 to January 2013, the economy added approximately 4.7 million jobs (according to the seasonally adjusted total nonfarm employment numbers). This suggests significant job growth, but the specific figure from 2010 to May 2013 would be slightly higher, considering the ongoing growth trend.

However, the article also notes that the amount of money received was not ""thousands"" but rather $1,000 from a lobbyist who represented Planned Parenthood, as well as other organizations.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the statement implies that McCollum accepted money directly from Planned Parenthood, which is not the case. The money came from a lobbyist who represented the organization, among others.

The statement claims that the Paris Climate Agreement is ""bad for America"" because it allegedly does nothing to hold major polluters like China and India accountable. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to examine the provisions of the Paris Agreement regarding the responsibilities of countries like China and India.

## Step 2: Examining the Paris Climate Agreement
The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It requires countries to submit their own plans for reducing emissions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are to be reviewed and increased in ambition every five years.

## Step 3: Accountability Mechanisms in the Paris Agreement
The agreement does include mechanisms for transparency and accountability, such as the requirement for countries to report their greenhouse gas emissions and progress toward their NDCs. However, the agreement relies on countries to set their own targets and does not impose specific emissions reductions on individual countries, which could be seen as lacking in holding countries accountable.

## Step 4: China and India's Commitments
Both China and India have made commitments under the Paris Agreement. China has pledged to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to 20% by 2030. India aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% below 2005 levels by 2030 and increase its share of non-fossil fuels in the energy mix to 40% by 2030.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement
The statement that the Paris Climate Agreement does nothing to hold real polluters like China and India accountable oversimplifies the agreement's mechanisms. While it's true that the agreement does not impose specific emissions targets on countries, it does establish a framework for transparency and review of countries' progress toward their self-determined goals. The claim ignores the fact that both China and India have made significant commitments under the agreement.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the information and the analysis, the statement is not entirely accurate. It misrepresents the nature of the Paris Agreement and the commitments made by countries like China and India. The agreement does provide a framework for accountability through transparency and review mechanisms, even if it does not impose specific targets on",R,environment,10000-50000

The statement refers to the Low Income Pool (LIP) and Obamacare, which are two different programs aimed at providing healthcare coverage to low-income individuals. The LIP is a program that provides funding to hospitals and other healthcare providers for uncompensated care they provide to low-income individuals, while Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a comprehensive healthcare reform law that includes provisions for expanding Medicaid and creating health insurance marketplaces.

## Step 2: Determine the relationship between LIP and Obamacare
The Low Income Pool and Obamacare are related in that they both aim to provide healthcare coverage to low-income individuals, but they serve different purposes and cover different groups of people. The LIP provides funding for uncompensated care, while Obamacare provides health insurance coverage to individuals and families through Medicaid expansion and the health insurance marketplaces.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement
The statement claims that the families covered through the Low Income Pool are a different group of individuals than those covered by Obamacare. This statement is partially accurate, as the LIP and Obamacare do serve different purposes and cover different groups of people. However, it is also important to note that there may be some overlap between the two groups, as some individuals may be eligible for both LIP funding and Obamacare coverage.

## Step 4: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on May 6, 2015, which is after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014. At that time, many states had already expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA, which would have affected the population covered by the LIP.

## Step 5: Label the statement
Based on the analysis, the statement is partially accurate but omits important details or takes things out of context. The LIP and Obamacare do serve different purposes and cover different groups of people, but there may be some overlap between the two groups. Therefore, the statement is half true.

The statement claims that for the first time ever, the critical needs waiting list for persons with unique abilities was completely funded, allowing them to get the help they need.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential sources for verification
To verify this claim, we would need to look at historical funding data for programs supporting individuals with disabilities or unique abilities, specifically focusing on the critical needs waiting list. This could involve government reports, budget allocations, or statements from relevant departments or organizations responsible for such funding.

## Step 3: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on 1/12/2016. This means we are looking for evidence of complete funding of the critical needs waiting list up to or including the year 2015, as the statement would reflect the status at the end of the previous year or the beginning of the new year.

## Step 4: Evaluate the availability of information
Without specific details on the jurisdiction (national, state, or local) or the exact programs in question, it's challenging to verify the statement directly. However, the claim of ""for the first time ever"" suggests a significant and potentially notable achievement that might have been reported or documented by relevant authorities or advocacy groups.

## Step 5: Assess the plausibility based on general trends
Historically, funding for social services and support for individuals with disabilities has been a subject of ongoing advocacy and often faces challenges due to budget constraints. A claim of complete funding for a waiting list, especially one described as ""critical needs,"" would be noteworthy and might be expected to be highlighted in public announcements or reports from the time.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Given the lack of specific details and the inability to access real-time or historical data directly within this format, the statement's accuracy cannot be definitively confirmed or denied without further research.

The statement claims that ""almost nine out of 10"" jobs lost in Ohio during Lee Fisher's watch were lost to other states, not to other countries.

## Step 2: Determine the context and timeframe of the statement
The statement was made on September 14, 2010, and refers to the period when Lee Fisher was in office, which would be relevant to his tenure as Lieutenant Governor of Ohio from 2007 to 2011.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available data and research on job losses in Ohio during the specified period
According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other economic reports from that time, Ohio did experience significant job losses during the late 2000s, largely due to the national economic downturn.

## Step 4: Assess the claim about the destination of lost jobs
Research indicates that while some jobs were indeed lost to other states due to factors like outsourcing and relocation, a significant portion of job losses were also due to the decline of industries such as manufacturing, which can be attributed to both domestic and international factors, including trade policies and global competition.

## Step 5: Consider the role of international trade and outsourcing in job losses
Studies and reports from the period suggest that outsourcing to other countries was a factor in job losses in the United States, including in Ohio. However, the exact proportion of jobs lost to other states versus other countries can be difficult to quantify due to the complexity of economic factors and data limitations.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on available evidence and context
Given the complexity of tracking the exact destination of lost jobs and the multifaceted nature of job losses during that period, the statement simplifies a complex issue. While it is true that some jobs were lost to other states, attributing ""almost nine out of 10"" jobs lost to this cause without clear, comprehensive data to support such a specific claim is problematic.

## Step 7: Determine the accuracy of the statement
The statement lacks concrete evidence to support its specific claim about the proportion of jobs lost to other states versus other countries. It oversimplifies the reasons for job losses in Ohio during Lee Fisher's tenure.

The statement mentions that in July alone, EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent, implying that this increase is at the expense of the speaker's country or market share, affecting their farmers and service providers.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential impact
The context suggests a trade agreement or situation where the EU's increased exports to South Korea are seen as detrimental to another party's economic interests, possibly the United States, given the date and the mention of ""our farmers and our service providers.""

## Step 3: Consider the date and its relevance
The date of the statement is 9/7/2011. This is significant because it was a time when trade agreements and their impacts were being closely watched, especially in the context of the Korea-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which was signed in October 2010 and came into effect on July 1, 2011.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the implementation of the Korea-EU FTA in July 2011, it is plausible that EU exports to South Korea increased significantly in the first month of the agreement's implementation due to reduced tariffs and other trade barriers. This increase could indeed affect the market share of other countries, including the United States, in the South Korean market.

## Step 5: Assess the availability of specific data
Without specific data on the exact percentage increase of EU exports to South Korea in July 2011, it's challenging to verify the ""over 36 percent"" claim directly. However, the context and the nature of trade agreements suggest that significant increases in trade are common in the initial periods following the implementation of such agreements.

## Step 6: Consider the potential for the statement to be true or false
Given the context of the Korea-EU FTA and its implementation timeline, the statement could be true, as trade agreements often lead to rapid increases in trade between participating countries. The impact on other countries' market shares is also a plausible consequence.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the analysis
Without direct access to the specific trade data for July 2011, but considering the context and the effects of trade agreements, the statement seems plausible and could be accurate. However, without concrete evidence or a direct source to confirm the ""over 36 percent"" increase, the statement should be treated with caution.

Red flag laws, also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), are laws that allow authorities to temporarily confiscate firearms from individuals who are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. These laws vary by state but generally involve a court process where a judge can order the removal of firearms based on evidence presented.

## Step 2: Analyzing the Statement
The statement suggests that Democrats want to take away guns from people based on the suspicion that they might do something, requiring them to prove they wouldn't do it. This simplifies the process and implications of red flag laws, which are designed to prevent harm after a thorough legal process, not based on mere suspicion without evidence.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Statement's Accuracy
Red flag laws do involve the temporary removal of firearms, but this is done after a court has reviewed evidence and determined there is a risk. The process typically involves a hearing where the individual can present their case, and the order is not permanent. It's not about proving a negative (that one wouldn't do something) but rather about addressing a demonstrated risk.

## Step 4: Considering the Context and Date
As of the statement's date (11/10/2019), red flag laws were a topic of national debate, with various states implementing or considering such laws. The political discourse around these laws was heated, with proponents arguing they could prevent gun violence and opponents arguing they could infringe on Second Amendment rights.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Given the simplification and the implication that guns are taken away without due process or based solely on suspicion without evidence, the statement misrepresents how red flag laws work. It ignores the legal process involved and the evidence required for such actions, suggesting a more arbitrary and less judicial process than actually exists.

The statement claims that the Obama administration admitted money from the Iran nuclear deal would go directly to terrorism. This requires verification of the administration's statements and the terms of the Iran nuclear deal.

## Step 2: Context of the Iran Nuclear Deal
The Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was agreed upon in July 2015. It involved Iran reducing its nuclear capabilities in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

## Step 3: Administration's Statements on the Deal
In various statements and interviews, officials from the Obama administration acknowledged that some of the money Iran would receive from the lifting of sanctions could potentially be used to fund terrorism. For example, in January 2016, the U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, stated in an interview that ""some of that money will end up in the hands of the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] or other entities, some of which are labeled as terrorists.""

## Step 4: Clarification and Additional Information
While the administration did acknowledge the possibility that some funds could be used for terrorism, it's crucial to understand that the deal's primary goal was to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The administration also emphasized that the deal included mechanisms to monitor and restrict Iran's activities.

## Step 5: Labeling the Statement
Given the information from credible sources, including statements from the Obama administration, the claim that the administration admitted money from the Iran nuclear deal ""would go directly to terrorism"" needs clarification. The administration did acknowledge the potential for some funds to be used by entities labeled as terrorists, but this was not the primary intention or outcome of the deal.

As of the statement's date (2/18/2014), Chicago did have some of the strictest gun laws in the United States. This included a ban on handguns that was in place until it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2010 (McDonald v. City of Chicago), and other regulations such as requiring gun owners to register their firearms and have a firearm owner's identification card.

## Step 2: Assess the claim about Chicago having the highest murder rate in the country.
According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which collects and analyzes crime data from law enforcement agencies across the United States, in 2013 (the year before the statement was made), Chicago did not have the highest murder rate among major cities. Cities like Detroit, Michigan, and St. Louis, Missouri, often had higher murder rates per capita. However, Chicago did have a high number of murders in absolute terms due to its large population.

## Step 3: Consider the relationship between gun laws and murder rates as presented in the statement.
The statement implies a direct relationship between strict gun laws and high murder rates, suggesting that despite having ""the most stringent gun laws,"" Chicago still experiences a high murder rate. This simplification overlooks the complexity of factors contributing to crime rates, including socioeconomic conditions, policing strategies, and the availability of guns from neighboring areas with less stringent laws.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on the analysis.
Given the information, the statement is misleading. While Chicago did have strict gun laws, the claim about it having the ""highest murder rate"" in the country is not accurate when considering the murder rate per capita, which is a more meaningful measure for comparisons.

The statement claims that ""The average rate of fraud"" in the Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps programs ""is 20 to 25 percent."" This statement involves multiple government programs and a specific percentage of fraud.

## Step 2: Evaluate the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) fraud rate
According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the EITC improper payment rate, which includes fraud, has been significant. For 2014, the IRS reported an improper payment rate of 22% to 26% for EITC.

## Step 3: Assess Medicare fraud rate
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report that the Medicare fee-for-service improper payment rate for 2014 was around 12.7%. This rate includes both fraud and errors, not solely fraud.

## Step 4: Evaluate the extent of the military cuts
The defense budget as a percentage of GDP did decrease during Clinton's presidency, reflecting a broader post-Cold War reduction in military spending. However, the term ""drastically"" can be subjective and needs clarification. The reduction was part of a planned post-Cold War downsizing, not an abrupt or unexpected cut.

## Step 5: Consider credible sources
Sources like the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Defense, and historical records from the Clinton administration would provide accurate data on military spending and personnel during that period. These sources generally support the notion that there was a reduction in military spending and personnel, but the characterization of this reduction as ""drastic"" might vary depending on the perspective.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given that there was indeed a reduction in military spending and personnel during Clinton's presidency as part of a post-Cold War adjustment, but considering the subjective nature of the term ""drastically,"" the statement needs clarification. It is not entirely inaccurate but lacks context regarding the global situation at the time and the planned nature of the reductions.

The statement claims that Iranian mullahs took American hostages and held them for 444 days, releasing them exactly when Ronald Reagan was taking the Oath of Office.

## Step 2: Verify the duration of the hostage crisis
According to historical records, the Iran hostage crisis began on November 4, 1979, and ended on January 20, 1981, which indeed totals 444 days.

## Step 3: Confirm the release of the hostages in relation to Ronald Reagan's inauguration
The hostages were released on January 20, 1981, which is the same day Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as the President of the United States. This event occurred just minutes after Reagan took the Oath of Office.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given that the hostages were held for 444 days and were released on the day of Reagan's inauguration, the statement is largely accurate. However, it simplifies the timing to ""one hour,"" which might not be precise but captures the essence of the event's timing in relation to Reagan's inauguration.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
The statement could benefit from clarification on the exact timing of the release in relation to Reagan's oath, as it was not exactly ""one hour"" after but rather around the time of his inauguration. However, the core of the statement about the duration of the hostage crisis and the release coinciding with Reagan's inauguration is accurate.

The statement claims that people cannot go fishing anymore because of Obama, implying that some policy or action taken by the Obama administration has resulted in a complete ban on fishing.

## Step 2: Research Obama's policies on fishing
During Obama's presidency, which began in 2009, there were various environmental and conservation efforts, including those related to marine life and fishing. However, a complete ban on fishing for the general public was not a policy implemented by the Obama administration.

## Step 3: Consider specific regulations or restrictions
While there were regulations and restrictions on fishing in certain areas or for specific species to protect endangered marine life or to prevent overfishing, these did not amount to a blanket ban on all fishing activities.

## Step 4: Evaluate the impact of Obama's policies on fishing
Obama's administration did implement policies aimed at protecting marine ecosystems, such as the creation of marine protected areas. However, these policies did not prohibit all fishing; they regulated it to ensure sustainability.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information, the statement that people ""can't go fishing anymore because of Obama"" is an exaggeration. There were regulations and restrictions, but they did not equate to a complete ban on fishing for everyone.

## Step 6: Label the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement is not accurate as it implies a complete ban on fishing due to Obama, which did not occur. It contains an element of truth in that there were regulations, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The statement is about donating to Haiti relief through the White House Web site and mentions ""high administrative costs"" associated with this method of donation. This context is crucial for understanding the potential accuracy of the statement.

## Step 2: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on January 18, 2010. This date is significant because it follows the devastating Haiti earthquake that occurred on January 12, 2010, which led to a massive international relief effort.

## Step 3: Evaluate the general practice of charitable donations
Typically, when donating to relief efforts through official government websites or well-established charitable organizations, a portion of the donation may go towards administrative costs. These costs can include expenses for managing the donation process, distributing aid, and overseeing relief efforts.

## Step 4: Research the specifics of the White House Web site's donation process for Haiti relief in 2010
Given the urgency and scale of the Haiti earthquake relief efforts, it's plausible that the White House and other organizations involved in the relief work would strive to minimize administrative costs to maximize the impact of donations. However, without specific details on the administrative costs associated with donations through the White House Web site at that time, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of the statement directly.

## Step 5: Consider the potential for the statement to be misleading
The statement could be misleading if it implies that the administrative costs are excessively high without providing context or comparison to other donation methods. It's also possible that the statement overlooks the efficiency and transparency of the donation process through official channels like the White House Web site.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on available information and reasoning
Given the lack of specific information about the administrative costs associated with donating through the White House Web site for Haiti relief in 2010, and considering the general context of charitable donations, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without more detailed evidence. However, the statement's implication about ""high administrative costs"" could be seen as potentially misleading or lacking context, which suggests it might not be entirely accurate or might omit important details.

The key claim in the statement is that ""$36 million in ongoing revenue"" has been cut in the last four years.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential sources for verification
Given the date of the statement (11/13/2012), we would need to look at budgetary or financial reports from the relevant entity (which is not specified in the statement) for the years 2008-2012 to verify the claim.

## Step 3: Consider the lack of specific information
The statement lacks specific details about who made the cuts (e.g., a government agency, a company) and what kind of revenue is being referred to (e.g., tax revenue, sales revenue). This lack of specificity makes it difficult to verify the claim without additional context.

## Step 4: Evaluate the plausibility based on common practices
In the context of government or corporate finance, it's plausible that efforts to reduce spending or increase efficiency could result in cuts to ongoing revenue. However, without specific details about the entity or the nature of the revenue, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of the $36 million figure.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on available information
Given the lack of specific information about the entity responsible for the cuts and the nature of the revenue, along with the absence of concrete data to support the claim, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without further context.

The statement claims that ""Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend."" This implies a direct financial benefit to families as a result of certain reforms.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement is 9/18/2014, we need to consider what reforms might have been implemented or proposed around that time that could lead to such a financial benefit. This could involve tax reforms, economic stimulus packages, or other policy changes aimed at increasing disposable income for families.

## Step 3: Evaluate the need for clarification or additional information
Without specific details on what reforms are being referred to, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of the statement directly. The statement lacks clarity on the nature of the reforms, how the $322 figure was calculated, and over what period this benefit is expected to be realized.

The statement claims that new figures showing Wisconsin job gains for 2011 are ""the final job numbers."" This implies that these figures are definitive and not subject to revision.

## Step 2: Consider the nature of job statistics
Job statistics, especially those related to employment rates and job gains or losses, are often subject to revision as more complete data becomes available. This is a common practice in many countries, including the United States, where initial estimates are later refined.

## Step 3: Evaluate the possibility of revisions
Given the date of the statement (May 16, 2012), and considering that the data in question pertains to 2011, it's plausible that preliminary figures might have been released before this date. However, the term ""final"" suggests a level of certainty that might not align with how job statistics are typically handled.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other statistical agencies often revise their estimates as more data becomes available. The process of revising job numbers is standard and can result in significant changes to initial estimates. Therefore, labeling job gains for 2011 as ""the final job numbers"" in May 2012 might be premature or misleading, given the potential for future revisions.

To assess the accuracy of the statement, we need to know which state's jobs website is being referred to, as the number of job openings can vary significantly from one state to another.

## Step 3: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on 9/20/2014. Job market conditions and the number of job openings can change rapidly, so the accuracy of the statement depends on the specific data available for that date.

## Step 4: Evaluate the availability of data
Without access to the specific state jobs website's data from 9/20/2014, it's challenging to verify the exact number of job openings. However, we can consider if such a number is plausible based on national trends and data from that time period.

## Step 5: Consider national job market trends in 2014
In 2014, the U.S. was recovering from the Great Recession. The national unemployment rate was decreasing, and job openings were increasing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of job openings in the United States was indeed increasing during 2014.

The statement refers to the Mary Burkes Madison school district and its stance on Act 10, a law that affects school districts in Wisconsin. To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to understand what Act 10 entails and how it impacts school districts.

## Step 2: Identify Act 10 and its implications
Act 10, also known as the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, was passed in 2011. It significantly changed the collective bargaining rights of public employees, including teachers, and had implications for school districts' budgeting and operations. Understanding the specifics of Act 10 and its requirements for school districts is crucial.

## Step 3: Research the Madison school district's stance on Act 10
To verify the statement, we need to find out if the Madison school district indeed chose to ""ignore the law"" in the 2015-16 school year. This involves looking into news articles, official statements, or documents from that time period that discuss the district's compliance or non-compliance with Act 10.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the date of the statement (9/3/2014), we are looking at a prediction or claim about the future actions of the Madison school district regarding Act 10 for the 2015-16 school year.

The statement claims that the speaker's property taxes decreased significantly due to a 35.5% reduction in the technical college portion of their taxes, which the speaker attributes to state funding.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement (12/12/2014), we need to consider if there were any changes in state funding for technical colleges around that time that could have led to a reduction in property taxes.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility of the statement
Without specific data on state funding for technical colleges and its impact on property taxes for the year 2014, it's challenging to verify the exact percentage decrease.

The statement was made on February 8, 2017. This date is crucial for verifying the claim as it pertains to the budget and spending at that specific time.

## Step 3: Research Wisconsin's education budget history
To verify the claim, we need to look at Wisconsin's education budget over the years, especially around the time the statement was made. This involves examining budget reports, news articles, and official statements from Wisconsin's government or education department from 2017 and preceding years.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim based on available data
According to various sources, including the Wisconsin Budget Project and news outlets, the 2015-2017 budget did increase funding for schools, but the increase was modest and did not fully restore cuts made in previous budgets. For example, the Wisconsin Budget Project noted that while the 2015-2017 budget provided a small increase in funding for schools, it did not keep pace with inflation, and when adjusted for inflation, the funding per student was actually lower than in previous years.

## Step 5: Consider the definition of ""investing more money""
The statement's claim of ""investing more money"" could be misleading if it refers to absolute dollars without considering inflation or the number of students. If the population of students has increased, then even with more absolute dollars spent, the per-student funding could be lower.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on the analysis
Given the information available and considering the nuances of budget increases versus per-student funding, the statement seems to oversimplify the situation. While there might have been an increase in the absolute amount spent on education, the context of per-student funding, inflation, and historical trends suggests that the claim might not fully capture the complexity of education funding in Wisconsin.

The statement claims that there are state workers who are ""idle"" at home during the coronavirus pandemic. This implies that these workers are not performing their duties or are not being utilized effectively due to the pandemic.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of the pandemic on workforces
The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread lockdowns, social distancing measures, and a significant shift towards remote work for many industries. This period saw a lot of disruption in how work was conducted, with many employees working from home if possible.

## Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of state workers being idle
Given the nature of many state jobs, which can include roles in healthcare, education, public safety, and administration, it's plausible that some workers might have been less active or ""idle"" in certain capacities due to the pandemic. For example, non-essential administrative tasks might have been reduced or put on hold.

## Step 4: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on June 5, 2020. At this time, many parts of the world were still under various forms of lockdown or restriction due to the pandemic, which could have affected how state workers carried out their duties.

Given the date and the context of the statement, it is likely referring to the administration of Governor Scott Walker, who took office in January 2011.

## Step 3: Find data on Wisconsin's rainy day fund for the relevant years
To verify the statement, we need to find the size of Wisconsin's rainy day fund at the beginning of Governor Walker's term (around 2011) and compare it to the size in 2015.

## Step 4: Locate credible sources for the data
Credible sources for this information would include official state budget documents, reports from the Wisconsin Department of Administration, or analyses from non-partisan fiscal policy organizations.

## Step 5: Compare the sizes of the rainy day fund
According to various reports and budget documents, when Governor Walker first took office in 2011, Wisconsin's rainy day fund had a balance that was significantly lower than in 2015. For instance, the fund had about $1.7 million in 2011 and grew to around $280 million by 2015.

## Step 6: Calculate the increase
To verify the ""165 times bigger"" claim, we calculate the increase: $280 million (2015) / $1.7 million (2011) ≈ 164.7 times.

## Step 7: Evaluate the statement based on the calculation
Given the calculation, the statement that Wisconsin's ""rainy day fund"" is ""165 times bigger than when we first took office"" is very close to the actual increase, considering rounding.

## Step 3: Look for relevant data or studies from around 2011
In 2011, the economic landscape and educational trends were significantly influenced by the Great Recession. Many individuals with four-year degrees were seeking additional training or certifications due to the challenging job market.

## Step 4: Evaluate the plausibility based on general trends
It's plausible that during a period of economic downturn, individuals with four-year degrees might seek further education or training to enhance their job prospects. Technical schools could offer a viable path for career advancement or transition.

## Step 5: Consider the need for specific data to confirm the claim
Without specific data from Wisconsin technical schools from 2011, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as true or false. However, given the economic context, it's conceivable that individuals with four-year degrees were seeking additional education.

## Step 6: Determine the most appropriate label based on available information
Given the lack of specific data to confirm the statement but considering the plausible context of the time, the statement seems to have a basis in the economic and educational climate of 2011. However, without concrete evidence, it's difficult to assert its absolute truth.

The statement claims that under President Barack Obama's jobs bill, an unemployed individual can sue if they believe they weren't hired because of their unemployment status.

## Step 2: Research the context and content of President Obama's jobs bill
President Obama's jobs bill, officially known as the American Jobs Act, was proposed in 2011. The bill aimed to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment through various measures, including tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and provisions to prevent discrimination against the unemployed.

## Step 3: Determine if the jobs bill included provisions related to suing for discrimination based on employment status
The American Jobs Act of 2011 did include a provision that would have prohibited employers from discriminating against job applicants based on their employment status. This provision was intended to prevent employers from refusing to consider or hire individuals simply because they were unemployed.

## Step 4: Assess if the provision allowed for lawsuits in cases of suspected discrimination
The provision in question would have given unemployed individuals a basis to sue if they believed they were discriminated against because of their unemployment status. However, the specifics of how this would be implemented, including the conditions under which someone could sue, would depend on the details of the legislation and its enforcement mechanisms.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on the research
Given that the American Jobs Act did contain provisions aimed at preventing discrimination against the unemployed, and considering that such provisions could imply legal recourse for those who feel discriminated against, the statement has a basis in fact. However, the exact mechanisms and conditions for suing would depend on the specifics of the law, which might not be fully captured by the statement.

## Step 6: Consider the date of the statement and the status of the jobs bill at that time
As of September 13, 2011, the American Jobs Act had been proposed but not yet passed into law. This means that while the statement reflects a provision that was part of the proposed legislation, it might not accurately represent the legal situation at the time, as the bill had not been enacted.

## Step 7: Conclude the accuracy of the statement based on the analysis
The statement is partially accurate in that it reflects a provision that was part of the proposed American Jobs Act.

The statement claims that there are more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining as of the given date, 5/27/2014.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data sources for verification
To verify this claim, we need data on the number of jobs in the solar industry and in coal mining in the United States around the date of the statement (May 2014).

## Step 3: Find data on solar industry jobs
According to the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit organization that researches and analyzes the solar industry, their annual ""Solar Jobs Census"" provides data on employment in the solar industry. The 2013 census reported approximately 142,000 solar jobs in the United States.

## Step 4: Find data on coal mining jobs
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides data on employment in the coal mining industry. As of May 2014, the BLS reported that there were about 79,800 jobs in coal mining in the United States.

## Step 5: Compare the data
Comparing the numbers from the Solar Foundation and the BLS, we see that the solar industry had more jobs (approximately 142,000) than the coal mining industry (approximately 79,800) as of the relevant time frame.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the comparison
Given that the solar industry indeed had more jobs than the coal mining industry around the time of the statement, the claim appears to be supported by factual data.

The statement claims that the U.S. Supreme Court has never taken away a constitutional right.

## Step 2: Research historical Supreme Court decisions
Historically, the Supreme Court has made decisions that have both expanded and contracted individual rights under the Constitution. A notable example is the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), where the Court ruled that African Americans, whether free or slave, were not citizens and therefore had no right to sue in federal court, effectively taking away rights.

Considering the historical context and the specific timing of the statement, it is clear that the Supreme Court has, in fact, taken away constitutional rights in the past. The statement's accuracy depends on the interpretation of ""never"" and the specific rights in question. However, given the imminence of the Dobbs decision at the time of the statement and historical precedents, the claim that the Supreme Court has ""never"" taken away a constitutional right is not accurate.

The statement claims that the Trump administration has banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from using the word ""transgender"".

## Step 2: Research the context and facts surrounding the claim
According to reports from December 2017, the Trump administration did indeed instruct certain agencies, including the CDC, to avoid using certain words in budget documents, including ""transgender"". This was reported by The Washington Post on December 15, 2017.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on the research
Given the information from credible sources such as The Washington Post, it appears that the Trump administration did instruct the CDC and other agencies to avoid using the word ""transgender"" in budget documents. This action was part of a list of words or phrases to avoid, which also included ""fetus,"" ""science-based,"" and ""evidence-based,"" among others.

The statement claims that except for Donald Trump, every other major party nominee for the past 40 years has released their tax returns.

## Step 2: Determine the time frame in question
The time frame is the past 40 years from the date of the statement, which was made on 9/19/2016. This means we are looking at major party nominees from 1976 onwards.

## Step 3: Research the release of tax returns by major party nominees
Historically, it has been a common practice for major party presidential nominees to release their tax returns, although it is not required by law. We need to verify if there were any exceptions besides Donald Trump.

## Step 4: Verify the practice of releasing tax returns
According to various sources, including fact-checking organizations and news outlets, it is true that most major party nominees have released their tax returns since the 1970s. This includes nominees from both the Democratic and Republican parties.

## Step 5: Check for any exceptions besides Donald Trump
One notable exception before Donald Trump was Gerald Ford, who released a summary of his tax data but not his full returns. However, the statement specifically mentions ""every other major party nominee"" for the past 40 years, which would include nominees after Gerald Ford.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given that the vast majority of major party nominees have indeed released their tax returns, and considering the exception of Donald Trump, the statement is largely accurate. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the practice, while common, is not universal and has had exceptions.

## Step 7: Consider the context and any missing information
The statement does not provide context about why releasing tax returns is significant or mention any other potential exceptions. However, its core claim about the historical practice of major party nominees releasing their tax returns, with the exception of Donald Trump, is supported by facts.

## Step 8: Determine the label for the statement
Given the information and the criteria for labeling, the statement is accurate but could benefit from clarification on the historical context and the significance of releasing tax returns.

The key claim in the statement is that under Terry McAuliffe, there was a ""record investment in education.""

## Step 2: Determine the context and timeframe of the claim
Terry McAuliffe served as the Governor of Virginia from 2014 to 2018. To assess the claim, we need to look at the education budget and investments during his tenure.

## Step 3: Research the education budget during McAuliffe's governorship
According to various sources, including the Virginia Department of Education and news outlets, during McAuliffe's term, there were indeed significant investments in education. For example, in 2016, McAuliffe proposed a budget that included a substantial increase in education funding, aiming to improve teacher salaries and reduce class sizes.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim based on the findings
Given the information available, it appears that McAuliffe did prioritize education funding during his governorship, with efforts to increase the budget for schools and improve educational outcomes.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
While the statement suggests a ""record investment,"" it lacks specificity regarding what exactly constitutes ""record"" in this context (e.g., highest percentage increase, largest dollar amount). However, the general trend of increased investment in education under McAuliffe's leadership is supported.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation

The statement claims that before April 22, 2016, the rights of more than 18,000 individuals had been restored, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms.

## Step 2: Identify the key elements to fact-check
To verify the statement, we need to identify the number of individuals whose rights were restored before April 22, 2016, and compare it with the total number of restorations by the previous seven governors.

## Step 3: Consider the source of the statement
The statement seems to be from a political figure, possibly a governor, given the context of comparing their achievements with those of their predecessors.

## Step 4: Look for credible sources to support or refute the statement
Without specific data or sources provided in the statement, we must rely on general knowledge or available records from that time period to assess its accuracy.

## Step 5: Evaluate the plausibility based on known practices and data
Restoring rights to individuals, often in the context of voting rights or criminal record expungements, is a significant policy action. The claim of surpassing the combined total of the previous seven governors suggests a substantial effort in this area.

## Step 6: Consider the date and potential for verification
Given the date of April 22, 2016, and without access to real-time data or specific policy records from that period, we must consider the statement's plausibility based on typical governance and policy implementation practices.

## Step 7: Determine the label based on the analysis

The statement refers to Obama's mid-term approval ratings in comparison to other presidents who went on to re-election. This implies we need to look at historical data on presidential approval ratings, specifically around the mid-term point of their presidencies.

## Step 2: Identify relevant historical data
To assess the truth of the statement, we need to compare Obama's mid-term approval ratings with those of other presidents who were re-elected. This involves looking at the approval ratings of presidents like Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, among others, at similar points in their terms.

## Step 3: Gather specific data on Obama's mid-term approval ratings
As of January 2, 2011, Obama's approval ratings were around 50%, according to Gallup polls. This is a key piece of information for comparing his ratings with those of other presidents at their mid-term points.

## Step 4: Compare with other re-elected presidents' mid-term ratings
Historically, presidents who went on to win re-election had varied mid-term approval ratings. For example, Ronald Reagan's approval rating was around 63% in January 1983, Bill Clinton's was about 52% in January 1995, and George W. Bush's was around 60% in January 2003. These figures are based on Gallup polls and are subject to slight variations depending on the source.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the comparison
Given that Obama's mid-term approval rating was around 50%, which is somewhat lower than some of his predecessors who were re-elected but comparable to others, the statement can be seen as having some basis in fact. However, the comparison is not straightforward due to the variability in approval ratings among re-elected presidents.

## Step 6: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
The statement could benefit from more specific comparisons and acknowledgment of the range of approval ratings among re-elected presidents. Without this context, the statement might oversimplify the complexities of presidential approval ratings and re-election outcomes.

The statement to be fact-checked is: ""Says Donald Trump is 'against minimum wage.'"" This statement was recorded on 7/14/2016.

## Step 2: Determine Donald Trump's stance on minimum wage as of the statement's date
As of the statement's date (7/14/2016), Donald Trump's views on the minimum wage were evolving. Initially, during his presidential campaign, Trump expressed opposition to raising the federal minimum wage, suggesting it should be left to the states to decide. However, his stance shifted over time.

## Step 3: Research Trump's quotes and policies on minimum wage around the statement's date
In May 2016, Trump said in an interview with CNBC that he would consider raising the minimum wage to $10 or higher, but this was not a firm commitment. His campaign website at the time did not explicitly state a position on the minimum wage, but Trump had previously suggested that the minimum wage should be higher in certain areas with a high cost of living.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on the research
Given Trump's comments and the evolution of his stance, saying he is ""against minimum wage"" might oversimplify his position. While he did not actively campaign on raising the federal minimum wage and suggested it should be a state issue, he also indicated openness to considering increases under certain conditions.

## Step 5: Choose the appropriate label for the statement
Considering Trump's nuanced and evolving stance on the minimum wage, the statement ""Says Donald Trump is 'against minimum wage'"" could be seen as not fully capturing the complexity of his views. It contains an element of truth in that he was not advocating for a federal increase, but it ignores his openness to the idea under certain conditions.

The statement compares the tax burden on Virginia families under two different governors: Tim Kaine and George Allen. To assess its accuracy, we need to examine the tax policies and their impacts during their respective terms.

## Step 2: Determine the time frames of their governorships
Tim Kaine was the Governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010, and George Allen served from 1994 to 1998. These time frames are crucial for understanding the economic and tax policies in place during their terms.

## Step 3: Research tax policies under Tim Kaine
During Tim Kaine's governorship, Virginia experienced a period of economic growth, and there were efforts to balance the budget without significantly increasing taxes. However, specific tax rates and their impact on families need to be considered.

## Step 4: Research tax policies under George Allen
George Allen's term saw a different economic climate and tax environment. Notably, Allen oversaw a period of significant tax cuts, aiming to stimulate economic growth.

## Step 5: Compare the tax burden
To compare the tax burden, we must look at the effective tax rates and how they affected Virginia families during both periods. This includes considering income tax rates, sales tax, and any other relevant taxes.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on factual evidence
Given the complexity of tax policies and their varied impacts on different income levels and family sizes, a definitive comparison requires detailed data on tax rates, exemptions, and overall tax revenue as a percentage of personal income during both governorships.

## Step 7: Consider credible sources
Credible sources such as the Virginia Department of Taxation, the Tax Foundation, or academic analyses comparing tax burdens during these periods would provide the necessary data to assess the statement's accuracy.

## Step 8: Conclusion based on available information
Without access to specific data or studies directly comparing the tax burden on Virginia families during the Kaine and Allen governorships as of the statement's date (9/24/2012), a precise labeling based on the provided criteria is challenging. However, the process involves verifying tax policies, their implementation, and their effects on families during both terms to determine if the statement is true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, or implausible.

The statement claims that Georgians spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back from the federal government when it comes to transportation funds.

## Step 2: Identify key components
To fact-check this statement, we need to identify the key components: the amount Georgians spend in taxes, the amount spent on red tape, and the amount they get back from the federal government for transportation.

## Step 3: Research federal funding for transportation in Georgia
According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in 2014, Georgia received approximately $1.3 billion in federal funding for highways. However, this figure does not account for other forms of transportation or the specific costs associated with taxes and red tape.

## Step 4: Consider taxes and red tape costs
The cost of ""red tape"" is not easily quantifiable as it refers to bureaucratic or regulatory costs, which can vary widely and are not always publicly disclosed. Taxes, however, can be more straightforward. In 2014, Georgia's gas tax was 7.5 cents per gallon for gasoline and 7.5 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, which contributes to the state's transportation funding.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Without specific, detailed data on the total amount spent on taxes and red tape for transportation purposes, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as true or false. However, considering that the statement implies a net loss for Georgians when comparing what they pay in taxes (and the implied inefficiencies of ""red tape"") to what they receive from the federal government, we must look at the broader context of federal funding versus state contributions.

## Step 6: Consider the context of federal funding
Federal transportation funding is often allocated based on a formula that considers factors like the state's population, road mileage, and vehicle miles traveled. If Georgia is receiving $1.3 billion and considering the state's population and road network, the statement might oversimplify the complex relationship between federal funding, state taxes, and administrative costs.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Given the lack of specific data on ""red tape"" costs and the complexity of comparing federal funding to state and local expenditures on transportation, the statement seems to lack sufficient detail for a definitive judgment.

The statement claims that Tammy Baldwin supports a tax increase that President Obama says would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year. The key components are: Tammy Baldwin's support for a tax increase, President Obama's statement about the cost, and the specific cost of $3,000 per year to middle-class families.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential sources
Given the date of the statement (10/8/2012), it's during a significant political period, possibly related to elections or policy debates. President Obama's statements and policies, as well as Tammy Baldwin's political stance, would be crucial in verifying the claim.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on known policies and statements
President Obama and his administration were known for advocating for tax policies that would not increase taxes on middle-class families. However, there were discussions and proposals regarding tax increases on higher-income individuals. Without specific details on the tax increase in question, it's challenging to directly verify the claim. Tammy Baldwin's stance on tax policies would also need to align with or contradict President Obama's views to assess the accuracy of the statement.

## Step 4: Consider potential biases and missing information
The statement lacks specific details about the tax increase, such as its nature (e.g., income tax, sales tax), the income brackets it would affect, and how the $3,000 figure was calculated. Without this information, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim. Additionally, political statements often carry biases or are taken out of context, which could affect the statement's truthfulness.

## Step 5: Assess the statement based on available information and logical reasoning
Given the lack of specific details and the potential for political spin, the statement seems to be missing critical context. It implies a direct quote or endorsement from President Obama regarding a specific tax increase supported by Tammy Baldwin, which, without further evidence, is difficult to verify. The statement could be an attempt to misrepresent or simplify complex tax policy discussions for political gain.

FALSE,Tony Evers,"Says a Republican bill he vetoed would have implemented a ""mandate"" to make public the names of all students parents or guardians.",11/21/2019,other,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/03/tony-evers/tony-evers-misstates-schools-bill-he-vetoes-it/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that a Republican bill, which was vetoed, included a mandate to make public the names of all students' parents or guardians.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential implications
Understanding the context of the bill and its potential implications on student and family privacy is crucial. The statement implies that the bill would have compromised the privacy of students and their families by making their personal information publicly available.

## Step 3: Evaluate the need for fact-checking
Given the nature of the claim, fact-checking is necessary to verify the existence of such a bill, its content, and the veto. This involves looking into legislative records and news archives from around the date of the statement (11/21/2019) to find evidence supporting or refuting the claim.

## Step 4: Consider potential sources for verification
Credible sources for verification would include official government websites, legislative records, news outlets, and fact-checking organizations. These sources can provide information on the bill in question, its provisions, and the actions taken by the executive regarding the bill.

## Step 5: Assess the statement based on available information
Without specific details on the bill or the veto, a definitive assessment requires access to current and historical legislative data. However, the process involves checking if any Republican bill around that time aimed to mandate the public disclosure of students' parents' or guardians' names and if it was indeed vetoed.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the assessment
Given the lack of specific information in the question and the necessity for detailed fact-checking that involves external research, the statement's accuracy cannot be directly confirmed or denied without further investigation. However, the process for evaluating such a statement involves verifying the existence of the bill, its content, and the action taken by the executive, which would typically lead to a conclusion based on the criteria provided.

mostly-false,Vicky Hartzler,"Current school lunch requirements ""cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches!""",8/14/2018,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/sep/09/vicky-hartzler/hartzler-wrong-attack-healthy-school-lunches/,half true,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that current school lunch requirements lead to large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches. This implies that the regulations in place for school lunches are causing students to waste more food and be less interested in eating school lunches.

## Step 2: Historical Context of School Lunch Requirements
In 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act was passed, which aimed to improve the nutritional quality of school meals. The act mandated increases in the availability of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, and it set limits on the amounts of saturated fats, sodium, and calories in school meals. These changes were implemented to combat childhood obesity and improve the overall health of school children.

## Step 3: Evidence of Food Waste
Studies and reports from around the time of the statement (2018) indicated that there was indeed an issue with food waste in schools following the implementation of the new meal standards. For example, a study published in 2015 found that while the new standards led to healthier meals, they also resulted in increased food waste, particularly among students who were not accustomed to the healthier options.

## Step 4: Impact on School Lunch Participation
There were also concerns and evidence suggesting that the stricter nutritional standards led to a decrease in student participation in school lunch programs. Some students and parents felt that the healthier options were less appealing, leading to decreased participation and, consequently, more waste.

## Step 5: Evaluation of the Statement
Given the evidence from studies and reports around the time of the statement, it appears that the claim about current school lunch requirements causing large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches has a basis in fact. However, it's also important to consider the context and the reasons behind these issues, including the transition to healthier meal options and potential resistance from students.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement seems to be supported by evidence indicating that the implementation of healthier school meal standards, while beneficial for nutritional content, did lead to increased food waste and decreased participation in school lunch programs. However, labeling the statement requires considering whether it fully captures the complexity of the issue.
