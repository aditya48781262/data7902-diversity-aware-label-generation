The statement is partially accurate in that Lois Frankel did take a police helicopter to a dinner party, but it omits important details, such as the legitimate purpose of the event and the fact that the ride was paid for by a private donor, which gives a different impression of the situation.

The statement that ""Keystone XL allows Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else"" is mostly true. The Keystone XL pipeline is indeed designed to transport oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, where it can be refined and potentially exported. However, the statement could be clarified by noting that some of the oil may also be used domestically in the United States.

Therefore, the statement is labeled as: mostly true.

The statement that Obama's bill ""reduced welfare rolls nearly 80 percent"" requires context for a full understanding. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which was a bipartisan effort and not solely Obama's bill, is often credited with significant reductions in welfare rolls. This act introduced work requirements and time limits for welfare recipients, leading to a substantial decrease in the number of people on welfare. However, attributing this reduction to Obama, especially in the context of 2008, might be misleading because the major welfare reform legislation was passed before Obama's presidency and significant involvement in federal legislation. Therefore, while there was a significant reduction in welfare rolls, attributing it directly to Obama's bill without specifying which bill or considering the broader context of welfare reform in the 1990s could be seen as partially accurate but lacking in important details.

The Obama tax calculator was a tool created by the Obama campaign during the 2008 presidential election to help individuals estimate how much they would pay in taxes under Obama's proposed tax plan.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that ""Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan."" This implies a significant shift in Chrysler's operations from Mexico to Michigan.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available information as of the statement's date (1/16/2018)
As of the given date, there were announcements and discussions about automotive companies adjusting their production and manufacturing strategies in response to changes in the political and economic landscape, including the potential impact of NAFTA renegotiations and tax policies.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on known facts and announcements around the time
In January 2018, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) did announce plans to invest in its U.S. operations, including moving production of its Ram Heavy Duty truck from Mexico to Michigan. This announcement was part of a broader investment plan in the United States.

The statement claims that the U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years in 2016, with a GDP growth of only 1.6%, and attributes this to trade deficits hurting the economy very badly.

## Step 2: Verify the GDP growth rate for 2016

Trade deficits can have various effects on the economy, including potentially reducing GDP growth by increasing the amount of domestic demand that is met by foreign rather than domestic production.

Reasoning: 
The statement that ""122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield"" is labeled as ""mostly true"" because, as of the statement's date (3/7/2017), there were reports and data suggesting that a significant number of detainees released from Guantanamo Bay (Gitmo) had indeed returned to terrorist activities. However, the exact number and the specific characterization of all these individuals as ""vicious prisoners"" might require additional clarification or context. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) had reported on the recidivism of former Guantanamo detainees, indicating that a substantial percentage had been confirmed to be or were suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities.

The statement claims that Deborah Birx traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving, only to have them call the police and turn her in, and then resigned. However, according to reports, Deborah Birx did travel out of state to see her family for Thanksgiving in 2020, but there is no evidence to suggest that her family called the police on her or that she resigned as a direct result of this incident. In fact, Birx apologized for her actions, stating that she had made a mistake and would be more mindful in the future. She did not resign from her position as the White House coronavirus response coordinator until January 2021, more than a month after the incident.

The statement that the New York bike path assault ""was the ninth vehicle assault used by ISIS"" requires verification.

However, without access to real-time data or specific details on each incident, it's challenging to confirm the exact number of such assaults attributed to ISIS up to that point. The statement could be partially accurate in acknowledging that vehicle assaults have been a tactic used by individuals inspired by ISIS, but the claim of it being the ""ninth"" such incident may not be entirely accurate or up-to-date without further context or confirmation.

The statement is: false. 

Explanation: The statement was made on 5/16/2012, and it refers to ""new figures"" released by the speaker showing Wisconsin job gains for 2011 as ""the final job numbers."" However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) typically revises job numbers multiple times after their initial release, often due to more complete data becoming available. These revisions can occur several times and may result in significant changes to the initial figures. Given that the statement was made in May 2012 and refers to job numbers for 2011, it is likely that the figures mentioned could still be subject to revision by the BLS. Therefore, labeling the statement as ""false"" is appropriate because it inaccurately presents the job numbers as final when, in fact, they could still be revised.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The statement does not provide any evidence or credible sources to support the claim of ""more than 70,000"" job openings.
2. There is no context or information about the state jobs website, such as its name, location, or the types of jobs listed.
3. The statement lacks specificity and clarity, making it difficult to verify or confirm the claim.
4. Without more information or credible sources, the statement appears to be an unsubstantiated claim or rumor.

Therefore, based on the provided criteria, I would label the statement as ""implausible"".

The statement is: false. 

Explanation: 
The statement that Wisconsin's ""rainy day fund"" is ""165 times bigger than when we first took office"" as of August 3, 2015, cannot be verified as true without specific data on the size of the fund at the beginning of the administration in question and its size at the time of the statement. However, given the nature of the claim and typical political rhetoric, it's possible that the statement could be an exaggeration or not entirely accurate without further context or data. The claim seems to be related to the actions of a political administration, likely referring to the governor's office in Wisconsin, and such claims are often subject to political spin. Without concrete numbers or a source to verify the ""165 times bigger"" claim, and considering the potential for political exaggeration, the statement is labeled as false based on the lack of verifiable evidence and the context in which such claims are typically made.",R,transparency,10000-50000

The statement refers to a provision in President Barack Obama's jobs bill that would have prohibited employers from discriminating against unemployed job applicants.
