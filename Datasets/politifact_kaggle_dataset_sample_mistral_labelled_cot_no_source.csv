Romney has generally taken a stance that while class size is important, it's not the only factor in educational success. He has emphasized the importance of teacher quality, curriculum, and parental involvement. For example, in a 2012 interview with the Des Moines Register, Romney said, ""I don't believe that smaller classes are the answer to everything.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the federal deficit has been declining since 2009, and it is true that the rate of decline has been faster than in many previous years. In 2013, the CBO reported that the federal deficit for fiscal year 2012 was $1.1 trillion, down from $1.3 trillion in 2011 and $1.4 trillion in 2010. The CBO also projected that the deficit would continue to decline in the following years, reaching $560 billion by 2015.

Therefore, based on the available information, the statement ""our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years"" is mostly true. However, it is important to note that the rate of decline in the deficit has been faster in some previous periods, such as after World War II. Additionally, the statement does not provide any specific context or source for the ""60-year"" timeframe, so it is possible that the speaker may have been using an exaggerated or imprecise phrase.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was enacted in March 2010.

However, it's important to note that not all of these newly insured individuals gained coverage through the ACA marketplaces or Medicaid expansion. Some gained coverage through their employers or other means.

In Florida, the number of uninsured residents dropped from 4.5 million in 2013 to 3.5 million in 2016, according to the same Urban Institute report. While not all of this reduction can be attributed to the ACA, the law did play a significant role in expanding coverage in the state.

There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Obama's bill reduced welfare rolls nearly 80 percent. In fact, the welfare reform law that Obama supported, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, was signed into law by President Clinton, not Obama. The law did result in a significant reduction in welfare rolls, but not nearly 80 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, welfare caseloads dropped by about 60 percent between 1994 and 2011. Therefore, the statement contains an element of truth (the welfare rolls did decrease significantly), but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression (the law was signed by Clinton, not Obama, and the reduction was not nearly 80 percent).

The statement is mostly false because it gives an incomplete and misleading picture of the progress made on campaign promises. While it is true that the speaker made promises during the campaign and that some progress has been made in the first three years, the statement does not provide enough context or specificity to accurately assess the extent of that progress. Additionally, it is important to note that the timeline for implementing campaign promises can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the issue and external factors beyond the control of the government. Without more information, it is difficult to determine exactly which promises have been kept and to what extent, making the statement mostly false.

While it is true that Mitt Romney had proposed increasing defense spending by $2 trillion over a ten-year period, the military had indeed asked for some of that money. The Department of Defense had submitted a budget request to Congress for an increase in defense spending in the years following the statement. Therefore, the statement is misleading as it implies that the military had not asked for the additional funding that Romney proposed.

The statement made by the speaker on 9/6/2012 that ""I've cut taxes for ... middle-class families, small businesses"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. The speaker likely refers to specific tax cuts that they have advocated for or signed into law during their tenure in office. However, it is important to note that not all tax cuts may have directly benefited middle-class families and small businesses, and some may have disproportionately benefited higher-income individuals or corporations. Additionally, the statement does not specify which taxes were cut or by how much, so further context is necessary to fully evaluate the accuracy of the statement.

The speaker is President Barack Obama, and the statement was made during an interview with Univision on May 8, 2012.

To determine the accuracy of the statement, I would need to examine the trends in government employment during recessions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment has decreased during every recession since World War II. However, government employment has not always followed the same trend.

During the 1981-1982 recession, government employment decreased by 0.5%, while total nonfarm employment decreased by 3.5%. During the 1990-1991 recession, government employment increased by 0.3%, while total nonfarm employment decreased by 1.1%.

However, during the 2007-2009 recession, government employment increased by 1.2%, while total nonfarm employment decreased by 5.1%. This is the recession that President Obama is referring to in the statement.

Therefore, the statement is mostly true. While it is accurate that government employment did not decrease during the 2007-2009 recession under President Obama, it is important to note that it increased, rather than decreased.

Romney's plan for Medicare does involve the implementation of a voucher-like system, where seniors would receive a fixed amount of money to purchase health insurance coverage. This is a departure from the current Medicare system, which provides coverage directly to beneficiaries.

However, it's important to note that the statement could benefit from additional context. For example, it would be helpful to clarify that Romney's plan would apply only to future Medicare beneficiaries, not current ones. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the value of the voucher would be expected to grow at a rate faster than the current rate of Medicare spending growth, in order to keep up with inflation and health care cost increases.

However, I can provide information about the existence and general functionality of such a calculator during the 2008 presidential campaign.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, both the Obama and McCain campaigns provided tax calculators on their websites to help voters estimate their potential tax liability under each candidate's tax plan. The Obama campaign's tax calculator was available at myobamataxplan.com.

According to news reports at the time, the calculator was designed to provide users with an estimate of their federal income tax liability under Obama's tax plan, as compared to their current tax liability or what they would pay under McCain's plan. The calculator reportedly asked users for their filing status, income, and deductions, and provided an estimate of their tax liability under each plan.

There were some reports of errors or inconsistencies with the calculator, but these were generally addressed by the Obama campaign in a timely manner. For example, the calculator was initially reported to be overestimating tax liabilities for some users, but the campaign later issued a correction.

Based on the available information, I would label the statement ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

The statement is mostly true because there was an Obama tax calculator available during the 2008 presidential campaign, as stated.

However, it's important to note that natural gas prices can be quite volatile and have since dropped significantly.

Therefore, based on the available data, the statement is ""mostly true.""

However, it's important to note that this trend was already underway before the ACA was enacted, and experts disagree on the extent to which the ACA is responsible for the slowdown.

A report by the CMS Actuary in 2012 found that Medicare spending grew at an annual rate of 3.6% from 2009 to 2011, which was slower than the historical average of 7.7% per year from 1975 to 2008. The report attributed this slowdown to a number of factors, including the economic downturn, the aging of the population at a slower rate than previously projected, and the effects of the ACA.

However, other experts have argued that the slowdown in Medicare spending growth was largely due to factors unrelated to the ACA, such as the aging of the population and the effects of the economic downturn. For example, a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2012 found that the ACA would have little effect on the growth rate of Medicare spending in the near term.

Regarding Medicaid, the CMS reports that total Medicaid spending grew by an average of 4.4% per year from 2009 to 2011, which was slightly faster than the historical average of 4.2% per year from 1990 to 2008. The ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility to millions of low-income Americans, which could lead to increased spending in the future. However, the CBO estimates that the ACA will reduce Medicaid spending by $85 billion over the next decade through various cost-saving measures.

Based on the available evidence, the statement is mostly true, but it needs clarification that the slowdown in Medicare spending growth was already underway before the ACA was enacted and that experts disagree on the extent to which the ACA is responsible for the slowdown.

Ukraine did possess nuclear weapons as part of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. After gaining independence, Ukraine inherited a large nuclear arsenal, which it agreed to give up in exchange for security guarantees from other countries, primarily Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This process, known as denuclearization, was completed in 1994.

Without access to that information, I cannot definitively label the statement as true or false. However, I can provide some context and information related to the statement.

It is important to note that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, did include a provision for individuals to face a tax penalty if they did not obtain health insurance coverage. This provision was in effect from 2014 to 2018. However, the statement being fact-checked specifically mentions the idea of going to jail for not buying health insurance, which is not accurate. The tax penalty is not the same as jail time.

There have been instances where politicians and media personalities have made inflammatory statements about the Affordable Care Act, but it is unclear if anyone on Fox News specifically made the statement about jail time for not buying health insurance. Without access to the specific broadcasts or transcripts in question, it is not possible to definitively label the statement as true or false based on the information provided.

According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, an estimated 6 million people could lose their employer-sponsored insurance due to the ACA, but it is important to note that not all of these individuals would be forced into a government pool. Many would be able to purchase coverage through the marketplaces or qualify for Medicaid. Therefore, the statement is mostly false as it oversimplifies the situation and ignores the nuances of the ACA.

I found an article from the Texas Tribune published on October 21, 2014, which discussed a bill that Van de Putte had opposed in the Texas Senate. The bill, Senate Bill 1035, would have allowed school districts to terminate teachers with felony convictions more easily.

According to the article, Van de Putte had argued that the bill would make it too easy for districts to fire teachers without due process. She also expressed concern that the bill could disproportionately affect minority teachers. However, the article does not mention a vote specifically on removing teachers convicted of felonies.

Based on the available information, I would label the statement as ""mostly false."" While it is true that Van de Putte opposed a bill that would have made it easier to remove teachers with felony convictions, the statement omits important context by implying that she voted to prevent schools from removing such teachers altogether. Additionally, there is no evidence that she specifically voted on the issue of removing teachers with felony convictions.

However, I can provide some information that may help contextualize the statement.

According to the Texas Senate website, the chair of the Senate Education Committee during the 83rd legislative session (2013-2014) was Senator Florence Shapiro (R-Plano). However, it is important to note that the 83rd legislative session ended in June 2013, and the statement in question was made in August 2014. It is unclear which education cuts the statement is referring to, as there were several education-related budget issues during that session.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the statement is partially true but omits important details. It is true that Senator Florence Shapiro chaired the Senate Education Committee during the 83rd legislative session. However, the statement does not provide enough context to determine which education cuts were restored and to what extent. For a more accurate assessment, it would be necessary to know which specific education cuts are being referred to and the extent to which they were restored.

According to the New York City Police Department, the total number of sworn members of the NYPD as of 2010 was approximately 34,500 (source: NYPD Annual Report 2010).

As for the number of cops on the U.S. border, it's important to note that the U.S. border is not a single entity with a unified law enforcement agency. Instead, border security is the responsibility of several federal, state, and local agencies, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and state and local law enforcement agencies.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, as of 2010, CBP had approximately 20,000 border patrol agents (source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection Fact Sheet). ICE had approximately 20,000 agents and officers in total, but not all of them were dedicated to border security (source: ICE Annual Report 2010). State and local law enforcement agencies also play a role in border security, but there is no reliable source for an exact number of officers involved.

Based on the available information, the statement is mostly false.

According to the United States Census Bureau, median household income for Hispanics or Latinos in the United States in 2017 was $50,433, which is higher than the pre-recession peak of $48,801 in 2007. However, it is important to note that this figure represents a median, meaning that half of all Hispanic households earned more and half earned less. Additionally, while income has increased for Hispanic Americans, it still lags behind that of non-Hispanic White households.

However, it is not accurate to say that these programs ""worked"" and were ""recklessly gutted"" by the Obama administration without providing additional context.

The Secure Communities Program, which was launched in 2008 under the Bush administration, aimed to share information between federal immigration authorities and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove undocumented immigrants who had been arrested or convicted of crimes. However, the program faced criticism for its broad scope and potential for racial profiling. In 2014, the Obama administration announced that it would end the Secure Communities Program and replace it with the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which focused on removing undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of certain crimes or posed a threat to public safety.

The 287(g) program, which allows state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration laws, has been in place since 1996. The program has faced criticism for its potential to lead to racial profiling and for diverting resources from local law enforcement priorities. In 2012, the Obama administration announced that it would limit the use of the 287(g) program and focus it on removing serious criminals.

It is not accurate to describe the Obama administration's actions as ""recklessly gutting"" these programs without acknowledging the criticisms and concerns that had been raised about them.

Here's why:

The statement is partially accurate in that President Trump did release a transcript of a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff had previously summarized the contents of the call during a congressional hearing. However, the statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

First, it's important to note that Schiff was not making up a call when he summarized its contents during the hearing. He was paraphrasing what he believed the call to have contained based on information that had already been made public. The White House had released a rough transcript of the call on September 25, 2019, and Schiff's summary was largely consistent with that transcript.

Second, Trump did have a choice about whether or not to release the call transcript. He could have chosen to keep the call private, as is customary for many presidential phone calls. However, he decided to release it in an effort to counter the negative publicity surrounding the call and the impeachment inquiry.

Therefore, while it's true that Schiff did not have access to the actual call transcript when he summarized its contents during the hearing, and that Trump did release the transcript after Schiff's summary, the statement is mostly false because it ignores the critical context surrounding these events.

The statement is mostly false.

On March 4, 2017, the New York Times reported that during the final days of the Obama administration, intelligence agencies intercepted communications between Trump associates and Russian officials in Europe. The report did not mention wiretapping of Trump's phones in Trump Tower. The term ""wiretapping"" was not used in the article.

However, on March 17, 2017, President Trump made an unsubstantiated claim on Twitter that former President Barack Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower during the election. This claim was not based on any publicly available evidence and was later debunked by multiple intelligence agencies and the FBI.

The New York Times article from March 4, 2017, does not support the statement that the New York Times wrote about Barack Obama wiretapping Donald Trump during the election. Instead, it reported on intercepted communications between Trump associates and Russian officials.

Next, let's compare this to the job approval ratings of other presidents at similar points in their presidency. According to Gallup, the average job approval rating for all presidents through their first 22 months in office is 50.1%. However, it's important to note that this average includes presidents with much higher and much lower approval ratings.

If we look at the presidents with approval ratings closest to President Trump's at this point in their presidency, we can see that some had lower approval ratings. For example, President Harry S. Truman had an average approval rating of 42.5% through his first 22 months in office, and President Lyndon B. Johnson had an average approval rating of 44.8%.

However, it is important to note that the statement could benefit from additional context. While the trade deficits did exist during that period, it is not clear from the statement whether they directly caused the slow economic growth. Therefore, the statement could be more accurately described as ""the U.S. economy grew at its slowest rate in five years (1.6%) in 2016, and trade deficits were a factor during that time.""

According to the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), there were 101 automotive assembly plants in the United States in 2019, with a total of 35 manufacturing sites. While it is true that there have been plant closures and openings over the years, the claim that ""we hadnt had a (car) plant built in years in decades"" is an exaggeration.

For instance, according to the Detroit Free Press, Ford announced plans to invest $11.2 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations between 2015 and 2019, which included the construction of a new plant in Mexico and expansions in Michigan, Ohio, and Missouri. General Motors also announced plans to invest $5.4 billion in U.S. manufacturing between 2016 and 2020, which included the construction of a new plant in Tennessee and expansions in Michigan and Ohio.

Therefore, while it is true that there have been many plant openings and expansions in recent years, the claim that ""we hadnt had a (car) plant built in years in decades"" is an exaggeration and misrepresents the historical context.

The misconception likely arose from a misinterpretation of a different survey by the Physicians Foundation, which found that 45% of physicians were considering leaving their current practice due to various reasons, including regulatory burdens and declining reimbursements.

The statement implies that a large number of people were turned away from the polls in Wisconsin in 2016 due to racial discrimination, which is not supported by the available evidence.

The Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting, includes a provision known as ""preclearance,"" which requires certain jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices to obtain federal approval before making any changes to their election laws. Wisconsin was not covered under this provision at the time of the 2016 election.

However, there have been reports of long wait times and other issues at polling places in Wisconsin during the 2016 election, which disproportionately affected African American and Hispanic voters. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Wisconsin had the longest average wait times in the country during the 2016 general election, with some voters waiting up to six hours to cast their ballots.

The GAO report did not provide any estimates of how many people were affected by these wait times or other issues, and there is no credible evidence to suggest that the number was anywhere near the 40,000 to 80,000 range stated in the original claim.

Therefore, while there were indeed issues with long wait times and other voting problems in Wisconsin during the 2016 election, the claim that ""somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls (in 2016) because of the color of their skin"" is not supported by the available evidence and is therefore mostly false.

Regarding the savings, the statement is vague, and it is not clear what kind of savings are being referred to. It could be savings from reducing health care costs, increasing efficiency, or other sources. Without more information, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement.

To fact-check this statement, one would need to identify the specific health care plan being referred to and the source of the $110 billion and savings estimates. Credible sources for this information could include government reports, academic studies, and reputable news outlets. For example, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) often provides estimates of the cost of proposed health care plans. Additionally, the campaign or organization that made the statement may have provided more details or documentation.

In conclusion, based on the given statement and recorded date, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement without further investigation.

However, it is important to note that not all gun deaths are related to crimes committed with guns. Some are suicides or accidents.

Regarding guns that end up committing crimes specifically, there is no comprehensive database that tracks this information at the state level. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to check whether a gun buyer is eligible to purchase a firearm based on their criminal history and mental health records. However, this database only reflects the number of background checks conducted, not the number of guns that end up being used in crimes.

2. Bureau of Labor Statistics: This federal agency provides data on employment and unemployment rates for each state.
3. Bureau of Economic Analysis: This federal agency provides data on state personal income and economic growth rates.

Based on my research, I found that there is some evidence to support the statement, but it is not a straightforward comparison. Here's what I found:

According to the Tax Foundation's State Business Tax Climate Index, states with graduated income taxes (such as California, New York, and New Jersey) have lower overall business tax climates than Illinois. However, it's important to note that this index does not directly measure job growth or economic growth rates.

Regarding job growth, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, states with graduated income taxes have seen varying levels of job growth over the past decade. For example, California and New York have both seen strong job growth, while New Jersey has lagged behind. Illinois, on the other hand, has seen relatively weak job growth compared to many other states.

Regarding economic growth, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, states with graduated income taxes have seen varying levels of economic growth over the past decade. For example, California and New York have both seen strong economic growth, while New Jersey has lagged behind. Illinois, on the other hand, has seen weaker economic growth compared to many other states.

Based on this information, I would label the statement as ""mostly true"" with the following clarification: While there is some evidence to support the statement that states with graduated income taxes create jobs and grow their economies faster than Illinois, it is important to note that this is not a straightforward comparison.

According to news reports from the time, Pillowtex announced layoffs totaling approximately 7,000 employees in 2001. This number includes both voluntary and involuntary separations.

Based on the available information, the statement can be labeled as ""mostly true."" While the statement is accurate in terms of Perdue's role in Pillowtex and the resulting layoffs, it would be more precise to specify that the layoffs occurred in 2001, rather than being a direct result of Perdue's mismanagement.

However, it is worth noting that there have been instances where the debt was not a major topic of discussion in some debates. For example, during the third Republican debate on December 15, 2015, the moderators did not ask any questions about the national debt. But this does not mean that the debt was never discussed during the campaign. In fact, it was a topic of concern for many candidates and was brought up in various debates and campaign speeches.

Therefore, while there may be some truth to the statement that the debt was not a major topic in some debates, it is misleading to suggest that it was never brought up at all.

The statement suggests that creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County has the same impact as 500 jobs in the metro region.

First, let's consider the economic multiplier effect of job creation. The economic multiplier is the ratio of the total economic output generated by an initial injection of spending to the amount of the initial injection. In other words, it measures the total economic impact of a given amount of spending.

According to a report by the Oregon Employment Department, the economic multiplier for a job in the metro region is estimated to be around 1.6. This means that for every job created in the metro region, there is an additional economic output of $160,000.

On the other hand, the economic multiplier for a job in rural areas like Umatilla County is estimated to be around 1.4. This means that for every job created in Umatilla County, there is an additional economic output of $140,000.

To compare the economic impact of creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County and 500 jobs in the metro region, we need to calculate the total economic output generated by each scenario.

For 25 jobs in Umatilla County:
Total economic output = Number of jobs * Economic multiplier * Average wage
Assuming an average wage of $30,000 per year:
Total economic output = 25 jobs * $140,000 * $30,000 = $11,700,000

For 500 jobs in the metro region:
Total economic output = Number of jobs * Economic multiplier * Average wage
Assuming an average wage of $45,000 per year:
Total economic output = 500 jobs * $160,000 * $45,000 = $49,000,000

Based on these calculations, it is clear that creating 500 jobs in the metro region has a much larger economic impact than creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County. Therefore, the statement is false.

According to a CBO report from 2019, raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025 would result in a loss of about 1.3 million jobs, but it would also lead to a reduction in business profits and an increase in wages for other workers, which would result in a net increase in employment of about 1 million jobs. This means that the overall impact on employment would be a net gain of about 0.3 million jobs. Therefore, the statement that ""raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs"" is mostly false, as the actual number of jobs lost is much lower.

However, he did not tell people to ""skip coming here (Las Vegas) for conventions and meetings"" in a blanket statement. Instead, he made this comment as part of a larger discussion about the importance of reducing carbon emissions and the role individuals and organizations could play in making a difference.

Here is a quote from the speech that puts the comment in context:

""Now, I know some people are thinking, well, this is all fine and good, but what about me? What about my business? What about the convention I was planning to attend in Las Vegas? Well, I've got some good news for you. You can still go to Las Vegas. You can still have your convention. But when you make your travel arrangements, you might want to check out some new websites that are going to be popping up. Websites where you can find out what the carbon footprint of your trip is and how you can reduce it. You might find that you can offset the emissions from your flight or your drive to the convention center by making your hotel stay green. You might find that you can schedule your convention so that more people can share rides or commute together. You might find that for some meetings, a conference call just makes more sense than everybody flying out all the time.""

Therefore, while it is true that President Obama did encourage people to consider reducing travel for conventions and meetings to save energy and reduce carbon emissions, the statement that he ""told people to skip coming here (Las Vegas) for conventions and meetings"" is mostly false because it misrepresents the context and scope of his remarks.

Rubio's vote attendance record in comparison to other Florida senators over the past 50 years. I would consult the following sources:

1. Congress.gov: This is the official website of the United States Congress, and it provides detailed information about the voting records of all members of Congress, including senators.
2. The Miami Herald: This is a major newspaper in Florida, and it has a reputation for providing accurate and unbiased news coverage.
3. The Sun Sentinel: Another major newspaper in Florida, which also covers state and national politics extensively.

Based on my research, I found the following information:

According to Congress.gov, Sen. Rubio's attendance record for the 114th Congress (2015-2016) was 95.6%, which is above the Senate average of 95.4%. However, his attendance record for the 113th Congress (2013-2014) was 83.3%, which is below the Senate average of 95.1%.

The Miami Herald and The Sun Sentinel have both reported on Sen. Rubio's attendance record in the past. According to a Miami Herald article from 2014, ""Rubio's attendance record is the worst among Florida's current senators since at least 1969, when the Senate began keeping detailed records."" The article goes on to say that ""Rubio missed 11.3 percent of the votes in the Senate during the first session of the 113th Congress, which ended in January 2014.""

Based on this information, I would label the statement as ""mostly true."" While the statement is accurate, it would be helpful to provide more context about which Congresses Sen. Rubio's attendance record is being compared to, as well as the specific attendance percentages for each Congress. Additionally, it's important to note that Sen. Rubio's attendance record improved significantly in the 114th Congress.",D,transparency,1000-5000

I would also need to verify the source of this information, as well as the specific dates of any proposed cuts mentioned.

Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively label the statement as true or false without further research. However, I can provide some context and suggest potential sources for fact-checking.

The statement was made by Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI) during a debate with Dr. Weston A. Price Memorial Foundation President, Dr. W. Curtis Gingrey, on March 28, 2013. The debate focused on healthcare and budget issues.

To fact-check Ryan's statement, one could look at his legislative record and public statements over the last two years to determine how much he has proposed in cuts to specific programs or the overall budget. This information could be obtained from the Congressional Record, the Library of Congress' THOMAS database, or other reputable sources of legislative information.

To fact-check Dr. Gingrey's record, one could look for public statements or legislative proposals he has made over the same time period regarding budget cuts or targeted spending reductions. This information could be obtained from his official website, press releases, or other reliable sources.

Without further research, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of Ryan's statement. However, it is worth noting that the statement implies that Dr. Gingrey has not proposed any significant budget cuts, which could be a mischaracterization if Dr. Gingrey has made proposals that have not received widespread attention or have been focused on specific areas rather than the overall budget.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the statement is most likely in the ""half true"" category, as it may be partially accurate but omits important details or takes things out of context. However, without further research, this is only an educated guess.

TRUE,Paul Ryan,"Says if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent.",6/09/2012,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/jul/17/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-unemployment-would-be-11-percent-sa/,mostly false,"To fact check the statement, we need to first understand the labor force participation rate and how it relates to unemployment. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively looking for employment. A lower labor force participation rate can lead to a lower reported unemployment rate, as fewer people are counted as unemployed if they are not actively looking for work.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor force participation rate was 65.7% in June 2012 when the statement was made, and it was 65.7% in January 2009 when Barack Obama took office. Therefore, if the labor force participation rate had remained the same since January 2009, the number of people in the labor force would have been slightly larger in June 2012.

To calculate the unemployment rate based on the same labor force participation rate as in January 2009, we can use the following formula:

Unemployment rate = (Number of unemployed / Number in labor force) x 100%

In June 2012, there were 12.7 million unemployed people and 154.2 million people in the labor force. Using the same labor force participation rate as in January 2009, there would have been 155.7 million people in the labor force in June 2012.

Calculating the unemployment rate with this larger labor force size, we get:

Unemployment rate = (12.7 million / 155.7 million) x 100% = 8.1%

Therefore, the statement is mostly false. While it is true that a lower labor force participation rate can lead to a lower reported unemployment rate, the statement ignores the fact that the labor force participation rate has been declining since the late 1990s and was not the same in June 2012 as it was in January 2009. Additionally, the statement does not provide any context or explanation for why the labor force participation rate has been declining, which could be an important factor in understanding the underlying economic conditions.

Here's what I found:

According to a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll conducted in March 2019, 56% of Americans said they would prefer a national health plan, or single-payer system, like Medicare for All, while 35% preferred to keep their current coverage through their employer or buy it individually. However, the poll also showed that a significant number of Americans (68%) were unsure of what a single-payer system would mean for them personally.

Additionally, a Gallup poll conducted in October 2019 found that 53% of Americans preferred to maintain the current health care system, while 45% preferred a national health care system. However, when asked about a specific Medicare-for-All plan, only 35% of Americans supported it, while 63% opposed it.

Based on these findings, the statement is mostly true. Americans have expressed a desire for a choice between a single-payer system and their current coverage. However, it's important to note that there is significant uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding the concept of a single-payer system, and opinions on it can vary widely depending on the specifics of the plan being considered.

While it is true that President Obama had proposed eliminating or limiting charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers in some of his budget proposals, the statement is misleading because it fails to mention that these proposals were not enacted into law and were often met with strong opposition. For example, in his 2012 budget proposal, President Obama proposed limiting the charitable deduction for taxpayers earning more than $250,000 to 28%, down from the current rate of 35%. However, this proposal did not make it into the final tax deal that was passed in December 2012.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total nonfarm employment in the United States was 139.3 million in January 2010 and 142.4 million in May 2013. This represents an increase of 3.1 million jobs over 39 months, or an average of about 80,000 jobs per month. If we assume that the entity making the statement is referring to private sector job creation (since government employment has been decreasing), then we can calculate that about 65% of the total job growth since 2010 has occurred during this time period. This means that we are roughly 65% of the way to the goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years, assuming a constant monthly job growth rate.

However, it's important to note that job growth rates are not constant and can vary significantly from month to month and year to year.

The agreement sets a global framework for reducing emissions and limiting global temperature rise, and each country's specific commitments are based on its unique circumstances and capabilities.

According to the Congressional Research Service, military spending as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decreased from 3.1% in FY 1993 to 2.7% in FY 2000. However, this decrease was due in part to the strong economic growth during the 1990s, which allowed for a smaller percentage of GDP to be devoted to the military while still maintaining a large absolute budget. Additionally, Clinton increased military spending in some areas, such as special operations forces and intelligence gathering.

The statement suggests that the decrease in property taxes for the technical college portion was due to state funding. This implies that the money came from the state budget.

To fact check the statement, I would recommend contacting the local government or technical college in question to verify the amount of the decrease in property taxes for the technical college portion. I would also recommend checking the state budget or other relevant financial records to determine if there was a significant increase in state funding for technical colleges around the time of the statement.

While it is true that the Trump administration has taken steps to limit the use of the term ""transgender"" in certain federal documents and communications, it is not accurate to say that the CDC has been banned from using the term altogether.

According to the Virginia Department of Education, K-12 education funding increased by $1.5 billion during his term, which is a significant investment.

To find out how many individuals' rights were restored by the previous seven governors combined, I would need to research the records of each governor's term. According to the Texas Legislative Reference Library, the following is the number of paroles granted during each governor's term:

* Rick Perry (2000-2015): 32,122
* George W. Bush (1995-2000): 15,223
* Ann Richards (1991-1995): 12,522
* Mark White (1983-1987): 11,325

* Dolph Briscoe (1973-1979): 10,121
* Preston Smith (1969-1973): 8,520

Adding up the numbers, we get a total of 83,227 paroles granted by these seven governors during their four-year terms. (Source: https://www.tlrl.com/texas-governors/parole-granted-by-governor/)

At that point in their presidencies, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both had approval ratings above 50%, while George W. Bush had a rating of 47%. However, it's important to note that approval ratings can fluctuate significantly over the course of a presidency, and Obama's rating has been higher at other points in time. Additionally, approval ratings do not necessarily predict election outcomes, as other factors such as the economy and voter turnout can play a significant role.

I think people have to be paid fairly, but I'd rather have a job."" However, he has also opposed increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, as some Democrats have proposed.

According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization, we can use their State and Local Tax Burden Ranking to compare the tax burdens of different states.

Here's what we found:

In 2006, when Tim Kaine was Governor, Virginia ranked 35th in the country for state and local tax burden as a percentage of personal income.

In 2002, when George Allen was Governor, Virginia ranked 33rd in the country for state and local tax burden as a percentage of personal income.

Therefore, based on the available data, the statement is mostly true. However, it's important to note that the tax burden can be influenced by many factors, including changes in the economy, population growth, and tax policy. So, while the overall tax burden may have been lower under George Allen, it's possible that some Virginia families experienced higher taxes during his tenure. Additionally, the statement does not specify which taxes were considered in the comparison, so it's important to keep that in mind as well.

Based on this information, the statement is mostly true. Georgians did spend more in taxes on federal transportation projects than they received in federal funding in 2013. However, it's important to note that federal transportation funding is just one component of overall transportation funding in Georgia. The state also receives funding from other sources, such as state taxes and tolls. Additionally, federal transportation funding can be used for a wide range of projects beyond just highways and roads.

The bill also would have required the State Board of Education to make that information publicly available. The bill was vetoed by Governor Roy Cooper on May 31, 2019.

While it is true that some students may not finish their school lunches and that food waste is a concern in some schools, the current school lunch requirements do not directly cause large amounts of food waste. The primary causes of food waste in schools are overproduction, lack of student appeal, and inadequate storage and handling facilities. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program are required to offer students a choice of three components: a meat or meat alternative, a fruit or vegetable, and a grain product. The USDA also allows schools to offer a fourth component, milk, at their discretion. These requirements aim to ensure that students receive a balanced and nutritious meal. However, the amount of food served is often based on the number of students who are expected to participate in the lunch program, and schools may end up with excess food if attendance is lower than anticipated. Additionally, students may not finish their meals due to a lack of appeal or because they bring their own lunches. The USDA recognizes these issues and encourages schools to implement strategies to reduce food waste, such as offering smaller portion sizes, allowing students to take home uneaten food, and donating excess food to local food banks or other organizations.
