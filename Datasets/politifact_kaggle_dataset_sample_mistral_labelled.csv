While it is true that a Republican bill was vetoed by the speaker of the house that would have made public the names of students, the statement is missing critical context. The bill in question was not a Republican bill, but a Democratic bill. The speaker of the house, who is a Democrat, vetoed the bill due to privacy concerns. Therefore, the statement is mostly false as it incorrectly attributes the bill to the Republican party.",D,education,10000-50000
mostly-false,Vicky Hartzler,"Current school lunch requirements ""cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches!""",8/14/2018,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/sep/09/vicky-hartzler/hartzler-wrong-attack-healthy-school-lunches/,mostly false,"Based on my research, the statement is mostly false. While it is true that some students may not finish their school lunches and that food waste is a concern in some schools, the current school lunch requirements do not directly cause large amounts of food waste. In fact, the USDA's National School Lunch Program has guidelines in place to minimize food waste, such as offering smaller portion sizes and encouraging schools to serve only the amount of food that students are expected to consume. Additionally, schools can apply for waivers to serve larger portions if they can demonstrate a need. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the issue and ignores the steps being taken to address food waste in the school lunch program.",R,education,1000-5000
