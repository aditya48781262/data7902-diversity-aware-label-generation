The Quiones Plan, also known as the ""Florida Education Finance Program,"" was a proposed education funding plan introduced in the Florida legislature in 1999. The plan aimed to provide additional funding for public schools, particularly those in low-income areas, by increasing the sales tax rate and creating a new property tax. The plan was named after its sponsor, Senator John Quiones.

Governor Jeb Bush did indeed veto the Quiones Plan in 1999. However, the reason for his veto was not solely due to concerns about taxation without representation. Instead, Bush argued that the plan would disproportionately burden low-income families and small businesses, as they would bear a larger share of the tax burden than wealthier individuals and larger corporations. Bush also criticized the plan for not providing enough funding for education and for not addressing the root causes of educational disparities.

Therefore, while it is true that Governor Jeb Bush vetoed the Quiones Plan, the statement made by Alan Grayson that Bush vetoed the plan because it was ""taxation without representation on a large scale"" is mostly false. Bush's concerns went beyond just representation and encompassed the overall impact of the tax increases on different income groups.",D,economy,100-500

However, it's important to note that the US also has significant FDI in other countries such as China, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

While it is true that some critics of Social Security in the 1930s expressed concerns about its potential impact on the workforce, the idea that Social Security was advocated as a way to get people to quit working is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of the historical record.

The Social Security Act was signed into law on August 14, 1935, and the program began paying benefits in 1936. George Will's statement was made on February 9, 2014, over 79 years after the passage of the Social Security Act.

Critics of Social Security during the 1930s did express concerns about its potential impact on the workforce. For example, Senator Robert Wagner, a key sponsor of the Social Security Act, acknowledged during the debate on the bill that some people might choose to retire early because of the benefits. However, he also emphasized that the program was intended to provide a safety net for the elderly and disabled, and that it would not discourage work.

Moreover, the idea that Social Security was advocated as a way to get people to quit working is not supported by the historical record. In fact, the primary motivation for the creation of Social Security was to address the economic hardships faced by the elderly and disabled during the Great Depression. The program was also seen as a way to stimulate the economy by providing a source of income for retirees and reducing poverty among the elderly.

In fact, Sanders supported subsequent legislation specifically for the auto industry, including the Auto Industry Financing Program (AIFP) in December 2008 and the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS) in April 2009.

Additionally, the statement does not specify which industries or demographic groups are experiencing these wage declines, and it is possible that other factors, such as changes in the labor market or economic conditions, could be contributing to the observed trend.

For example, Onyango was granted asylum and later became a legal resident, and she was not ""allowed to stay in this country"" indefinitely as an illegal alien. Additionally, there is no evidence that President Obama's uncle, Onyango Obama, was an illegal immigrant.

However, the actual quote from Huckabee is ""We would take a popcorn popper and put squirrel in it and cook it that way."" This distinction is important because popping and frying are two different cooking methods. Popping involves heating oil to a high temperature and then adding food to pop when the oil is ready, while frying involves cooking food in hot oil continuously. In Huckabee's case, he used the popcorn popper to cook squirrel by heating it up and then adding the squirrel, but he did not fry the squirrel in the traditional sense.

Mitt Romney's statement that ""under the Obama economy ... utility bills are higher"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. According to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), residential electricity prices have increased by an average of 2.4% per year from 2008 to 2012, which is slightly faster than the overall inflation rate during that period. Natural gas prices have also risen significantly during this time, leading to higher costs for utilities that rely on natural gas.

However, it's important to note that utility bills are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the president, including local and state regulations, weather patterns, and market conditions. Therefore, while it's accurate to say that utility bills have generally gone up during the Obama administration, it's not entirely fair to attribute this trend solely to economic policies enacted by the president.

The Biden-Harris campaign has proposed several tax policies, which include raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, increasing the top individual income tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, and eliminating the stepped-up basis for capital gains tax. However, they have also proposed tax cuts for middle-class families, such as expanding the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit.

The middle 20% of earners would see an average tax increase of $200.

Therefore, based on the available information, the statement made by Nikki Haley that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ""want massive tax hikes on working families"" is mostly false.

Explanation:

Paul Ryan's statement that ""if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent"" is mostly false. While it is true that the labor force participation rate has decreased since Obama took office, it is not accurate to say that a return to the participation rate at that time would result in an unemployment rate of 11 percent.

The relationship between the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate is not a simple one-to-one correlation. Other economic factors, such as the overall health of the economy and demographic trends, also play a role in determining both rates.

Additionally, it is important to note that the labor force participation rate was actually higher in the late 1990s and early 2000s, during periods of low unemployment. Therefore, it is not accurate to suggest that the participation rate at the time Obama took office was the only or best benchmark for comparing unemployment rates.

Pete Buttigieg's statement that ""Americans say that what they want is a choice to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance"" is mostly true. According to various polls, a significant number of Americans support a single-payer healthcare system, but they also want the option to keep their private insurance if they prefer it.

Private sector employment in Chicago has been steadily increasing since the Great Recession, and while the January 2018 figure was a new record, it was not a sudden or unexpected development. Additionally, the statement does not take into account the overall employment picture in Chicago, which includes government employment as well as private sector employment. The city's total employment also reached a record high in January 2018, but that was due in large part to an increase in government employment.

According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, in 2012, Chicago had the third-highest murder rate among cities in the United States, with 506 murders. New Orleans had the highest murder rate with 654 murders, and Detroit had the second-highest with 419 murders.

Therefore, the statement made by Ron Johnson on 2/18/2014 that ""Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country"" is mostly false. While Chicago does have a high murder rate, it is not the highest in the country.

Additionally, it is important to note that Chicago does have some of the most stringent gun laws in the country. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Chicago has a ""strong"" gun law rating, which is the highest rating given by the organization. This rating is based on factors such as background checks, permitting requirements, and restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Rudy Giuliani's statement that ""Bill Clinton cut the military drastically"" is partially accurate but omits important details.

According to the Congressional Research Service, Clinton's defense budgets were higher in real terms than those of his predecessor, George H.W. Bush, and his successor, George W.

The one hour referenced in the statement likely refers to the Algiers Accord, which was signed on January 19, 1981, leading to the release of the hostages.

Label: half true

Explanation:

Saxby Chambliss' statement is partially accurate but omits important details. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), not the Department of Defense, is the primary federal agency funding cancer research in the United States. According to the NIH's National Cancer Institute (NCI), the funding for specific cancer types varies significantly.

As of 2013, the NCI's budget for research on prostate cancer was approximately $192 million, breast cancer $126 million, and ovarian cancer $32 million. However, these figures include funding for research grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts, as well as intramural research.

The Department of Defense does contribute to cancer research, but its funding is a small fraction of the total. For instance, the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) of the Department of Defense's Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs invests in prostate cancer research ($120 million in 2013), breast cancer research ($60 million in 2013), and ovarian cancer research ($20 million in 2013).

Scott Walker's statement that ""More than 70,000"" job openings are listed on a state jobs website is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. According to a report by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development's job listings website did indeed show over 70,000 job openings in late September 2014. However, it's important to note that not all of these jobs were newly created positions, and some of them may have been listed for an extended period of time. Additionally, the number of job openings can fluctuate daily, so it's possible that the number was higher or lower at different times.

Additionally, schools have implemented various strategies to reduce food waste, such as offering smaller portion sizes, donating excess food to local food banks, and implementing ""take-home"" programs.

Therefore, the statement made by Vicky Hartzler is mostly false as it oversimplifies the issue and ignores the various factors that contribute to food waste in school lunches.",R,education,1000-5000
