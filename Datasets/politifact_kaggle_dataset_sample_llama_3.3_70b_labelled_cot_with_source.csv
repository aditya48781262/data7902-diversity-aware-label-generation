To determine the accuracy of the statement, we need to consider the context and available evidence. The statement claims that Lois Frankel took a ""police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party"" while she was mayor.

## Step 2: Consider the source of the statement
The statement is attributed to Adam Hasner, which may indicate a potential bias or political motivation, as political opponents often make claims about each other.

## Step 3: Assess the plausibility of the claim
Taking a police helicopter to a dinner party seems unusual and potentially inappropriate use of public resources. Without further context or evidence, it's difficult to assess the truthfulness of this claim.

## Step 4: Determine the need for additional information
Given the lack of specific details and the potential for political bias, it's necessary to consider if there's any evidence or clarification that could support or refute this claim.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Considering the potential for bias, the unusual nature of the claim, and the lack of provided evidence, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely true without further investigation. However, without explicit evidence to the contrary or more context, we cannot immediately dismiss it as false either.

half-true,Alan Grayson,"Says Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed the ""Quiones Plan"" because it was ""taxation without representation on a large scale.""",8/06/2012,campaign,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/aug/06/alan-grayson/grayson-says-jeb-bush-vetoed-quinones-plan/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed the ""Quiones Plan"" because it was ""taxation without representation on a large scale."" The key elements to verify are the existence of the ""Quiones Plan,"" Gov. Jeb Bush's action regarding this plan, and the reason behind his veto.

## Step 2: Research the ""Quiones Plan"" and its context
The ""Quiones Plan"" is not a widely recognized term in broad historical or political contexts without more specific details. It's possible that it refers to a specific legislative proposal or plan related to taxation or representation in Florida during Jeb Bush's governorship (1999-2007).

## Step 3: Verify Gov. Jeb Bush's actions and statements
Without specific details on the ""Quiones Plan,"" it's challenging to directly verify Gov. Bush's actions regarding this plan. However, the phrase ""taxation without representation"" is a well-known political slogan that refers to a situation where a government imposes taxes on a group of people without giving them the right to vote on those taxes or have representation in the government.

## Step 4: Consider the source and date of the statement
The statement is attributed to Alan Grayson, a politician known for his progressive views, and is dated 8/6/2012. The source and date suggest that the statement might be part of a political discourse or campaign, which could influence its accuracy or the context in which it's presented.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Given the lack of specific information about the ""Quiones Plan"" and without direct evidence of Gov. Bush's veto and his exact reasoning, it's difficult to label the statement as entirely true or false. However, the use of the phrase ""taxation without representation"" suggests that there might be some basis in fact regarding concerns over representation and taxation, but the specifics are unclear.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label
Considering the steps above, the statement seems to lack sufficient detail for a definitive verification. The phrase ""taxation without representation"" is a real political concern, but without more context about the ""Quiones Plan"" and Gov. Bush's actions, the statement cannot be fully confirmed. It appears to be partially accurate but omits important details or takes things out of context.

The statement claims that U.S. troops are receiving only 4 hours of Ebola training before being deployed to Liberia. The key components here are the duration of the training (4 hours) and the location of deployment (Liberia).

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on October 20, 2014. During this time, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, particularly in Liberia, was a significant global health concern. The U.S. military was involved in efforts to combat the outbreak.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility of the training duration
Given the complexity and risks associated with Ebola, 4 hours of training seems insufficient for preparing troops for deployment to an area with a high risk of Ebola transmission. However, without specific details on the content and quality of the training, it's difficult to assess its adequacy solely based on duration.

## Step 4: Assess the credibility of the source
Allen West, the source of the statement, is a former U.S. Representative and a commentator known for his conservative views. While he may have access to certain information, his statements can also be politically motivated or not entirely factual.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Without direct evidence or confirmation from official sources (such as the U.S. Department of Defense) regarding the exact duration of Ebola training for troops deployed to Liberia in 2014, it's challenging to verify the statement's accuracy. However, considering the urgency and severity of the Ebola outbreak, it's plausible that some form of expedited training was implemented.

## Step 6: Consider the potential for misinformation or lack of context
The statement might be missing context about the nature of the training, whether it was part of a larger training program, or if it was specifically tailored for the situation in Liberia. Additionally, the political context of the statement could influence its accuracy.

The key claim is that ""the rate of uninsured children is now rising"" after a decade of progress.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 12/3/2018 by Amy Klobuchar. This date is crucial because it allows us to look for data and trends around that time regarding the rate of uninsured children.

## Step 3: Recall or research relevant data or reports from around that time
Around 2018, there were reports and studies indicating a rise in the number of uninsured children in the United States after years of decline. This was attributed to various factors, including changes in policy and economic conditions.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Given the information available around the time of the statement, it is known that after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented, the rate of uninsured children did decrease significantly. However, by 2017 and into 2018, there were signs that this trend was reversing, with an increase in the number of uninsured children due to factors like the repeal of the individual mandate and other policy changes.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Based on the available data and trends observed around 2018, the statement that ""the rate of uninsured children is now rising"" after a decade of progress appears to be supported by factual evidence. Reports from reputable sources, such as the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, noted an increase in the number of uninsured children in 2017 and potentially into 2018, aligning with the statement's claim.

The statement claims that Rhode Island's voter identification law was pushed by ""a black Democrat in the House, a black Democrat in the Senate."" This implies that the legislation had significant support or was sponsored by African American Democrats in both chambers of the Rhode Island legislature.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential for verification
Given the date of the statement (9/27/2012) and the source (Ann Coulter), it's essential to verify the claim through factual records or news articles from that time period. The claim can be checked against the legislative history of Rhode Island's voter identification law, specifically looking for the sponsors and supporters of the bill.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility based on known facts
Without direct access to the specific legislative records or news articles from 2012, we can still consider the plausibility of the statement. Voter identification laws have been a topic of political debate, often along partisan lines, with Democrats generally opposing stricter voter ID laws due to concerns about voter suppression. However, the specific involvement of African American Democrats in sponsoring such a law in Rhode Island would be unusual and noteworthy.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the lack of specific information or evidence provided in the statement or the steps above, and without direct access to verify the legislative history of Rhode Island's voter ID law as of 2012, the statement's accuracy cannot be confirmed solely based on the information given. However, considering the political context and the typical positions of Democrats on voter ID laws, the claim seems unusual and might be misleading or incomplete.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the criteria
Given the information and the analysis, the statement seems to lack sufficient evidence or context to be confirmed as entirely true. The political context suggests that Democrats, especially African American Democrats, would be less likely to push for voter ID laws, which are often associated with Republican legislative efforts. Without concrete evidence or further clarification, the statement cannot be labeled as true or mostly true. It might contain an element of truth but likely ignores critical facts or takes things out of context.

The key claim is that Barack Obama is ""the only candidate who doesn't take a dime from oil company PACs or lobbyists.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on April 16, 2008, during a presidential campaign. This context suggests that the claim is related to Obama's campaign financing policies.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on available information
As of the given date, Barack Obama had indeed made a pledge not to accept contributions from oil company PACs (Political Action Committees) or lobbyists. This was a part of his campaign's stance on reducing the influence of special interest groups.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the claim
Given the information available up to April 16, 2008, and considering Obama's campaign promises and policies, the claim that he does not take money from oil company PACs or lobbyists aligns with his stated campaign finance policies.

## Step 5: Consider if other candidates also did not take money from oil company PACs or lobbyists
Without specific information on the practices of all other candidates at that time, it's challenging to definitively confirm Obama was the ""only"" candidate adhering to this policy. However, the statement's focus is on Obama's own policy, which was verifiable.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given that Obama did indeed pledge not to take contributions from oil company PACs or lobbyists, and considering the context of the statement, the claim about his policy is accurate.

FALSE,Barack Obama,"Under the White Houses budget proposal, ""we will not be adding more to the national debt"" by the middle of the decade.",2/15/2011,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/feb/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-white-house-budget-would-not-add/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Understand the statement
The statement claims that under the White House's budget proposal, there will be no addition to the national debt by the middle of the decade. This statement was made by Barack Obama on February 15, 2011.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the economic context and budget proposals around that time. The middle of the decade refers to 2015, given the statement was made in 2011.

## Step 3: Recall budget and debt trends
Historically, the national debt has continued to grow over decades, with occasional periods of reduction in the rate of growth but rarely a complete halt in additions to the debt. The claim of not adding more to the national debt by the middle of the decade seems ambitious, especially considering the economic conditions following the 2008 financial crisis.

## Step 4: Evaluate the feasibility of the claim
Given the typical growth of government spending and the challenges in significantly reducing deficits to zero within a short timeframe, the claim appears overly optimistic without drastic and unprecedented fiscal policy changes.

## Step 5: Consider Obama's budget proposals and outcomes
Obama's budget proposals during his presidency aimed at reducing the deficit, but the national debt continued to rise. The claim that no more would be added to the national debt by the middle of the decade (2015) would require a significant turnaround in budget balances, which was not achieved.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Given the historical context, the typical challenges in balancing budgets, and the continued growth of the national debt during Obama's presidency, the statement appears to be not accurate. The national debt did continue to grow beyond 2011 and into the middle of the decade.

The statement claims that the ""pay-as-you-go"" principle was instrumental in transforming large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s.

## Step 2: Recall historical context
In the 1990s, the United States did experience a shift from running large budget deficits to achieving surpluses. This change is often attributed to a combination of factors including economic growth, budget agreements, and changes in fiscal policy.

## Step 3: Identify the role of ""pay-as-you-go""
""Pay-as-you-go"" refers to a budgeting rule that requires new spending or tax cuts to be offset by equivalent spending reductions or revenue increases, thereby not increasing the deficit. This principle was indeed a part of the budget agreements in the 1990s, such as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, which helped in reducing the deficit.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the historical context and the role of ""pay-as-you-go"" in budgeting during the 1990s, the statement that this principle helped transform large deficits into surpluses is supported by factual evidence. The principle, along with other economic factors, contributed to the budget surpluses achieved in the late 1990s.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
While the statement is accurate, it simplifies the complex factors that led to the budget surpluses of the 1990s. Other significant factors included economic growth, increases in tax revenues, and reductions in defense spending following the end of the Cold War.

The statement claims that economists Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein have said that paying for Mitt Romney's tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made by Barack Obama on 10/7/2012, during a presidential election campaign. This context suggests that the statement might be part of a political debate.

## Step 3: Evaluate the credibility of the sources mentioned
Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein are both well-known economists. However, without direct quotes or references to their specific statements on Romney's tax cuts, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility of the statement
Given the political context, it's plausible that economists could have analyzed Romney's tax plan and concluded that it would require tax increases on certain income groups to be revenue-neutral. However, the absence of direct evidence or quotes from Rosen and Feldstein makes it challenging to confirm the statement's accuracy.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the available information
Considering the lack of direct evidence and the potential for the statement to be taken out of context or exaggerated for political purposes, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely true without further information.

The statement is made by Barack Obama on January 27, 2010, claiming that ""Because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed."" This statement is related to the economic policies implemented during his presidency, particularly in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

## Step 2: Consider the economic context of the time
In 2008, the United States faced a severe financial crisis, leading to significant job losses. The Obama administration implemented several measures, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), to stimulate the economy and create jobs.

## Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the economic stimulus
Studies and reports from that time, including those from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), suggested that the stimulus package had a positive effect on employment. The CBO estimated that the ARRA would increase employment by between 1.4 million and 3.8 million jobs by the end of 2010.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy
Given the estimates from the CBO and other economic analyses, it is plausible that the steps taken by the Obama administration, including the stimulus package, contributed to saving or creating millions of jobs. The statement of ""about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed"" falls within the range of estimated job impacts from the stimulus.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the context, the economic policies implemented, and the estimates from reputable sources like the CBO, the statement appears to be supported by factual evidence. However, the exact number of jobs saved or created can be subject to various estimates and interpretations.

The key claim is that the Obama administration was the first in history to post White House visitor records online.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on January 27, 2010. This is important because it allows us to verify if, up to that point, any previous administration had made such records publicly available online.

## Step 3: Evaluate the historical accuracy of the claim
Prior to the Obama administration, there was no publicly available online record of White House visitors. The Obama administration indeed took steps to increase transparency, including the release of visitor logs.

## Step 4: Determine the truthfulness of the statement based on known facts
Given that the Obama administration did initiate the practice of posting White House visitor logs online and there is no evidence to suggest any previous administration did so, the statement appears to be accurate.

The statement is ""Mitt Romney says class sizes don't matter"" and it was made by Barack Obama on 8/22/2012.

## Step 2: Determine the context of the statement
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to understand the context in which Mitt Romney made his comments about class sizes. This involves looking into educational policies or debates around that time.

## Step 3: Research Mitt Romney's stance on class sizes
In 2012, during his presidential campaign, Mitt Romney was involved in discussions about education reform. One of the topics was the impact of class sizes on student performance. Romney suggested that class size is not the most significant factor in determining educational outcomes, emphasizing other factors like teacher quality and parental involvement.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement for accuracy
Given Romney's comments, it's clear he did suggest that class sizes are not the primary factor in educational success. However, saying he stated ""class sizes don't matter"" might oversimplify or misrepresent his position, as he acknowledged the importance of other educational factors.

## Step 5: Consider the date and source of the statement
The statement was made by Barack Obama, Romney's opponent in the 2012 presidential election, which could introduce a political bias. The date, 8/22/2012, is during the campaign season, a time when political rhetoric is heightened.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given that Romney did downplay the significance of class sizes in comparison to other factors, but the statement simplifies his stance, it would be considered ""mostly false"" because it contains an element of truth (Romney did suggest class size is not the most critical factor) but ignores critical context that would give a different impression (he did not say class sizes have no impact whatsoever).

The statement claims that the Keystone XL pipeline allows Canada to transport its oil through the United States to the Gulf, where it will be sold elsewhere. This implies that the primary purpose of the Keystone XL pipeline is to facilitate the export of Canadian oil to international markets.

## Step 2: Consider the purpose of the Keystone XL pipeline
The Keystone XL pipeline is designed to transport oil from the Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries in the United States. While it is true that the pipeline would enable the transportation of Canadian oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the statement simplifies the pipeline's purpose and overlooks its potential benefits to the U.S. energy market.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
The statement is partially accurate in that the Keystone XL pipeline would indeed allow Canada to transport its oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, it omits important details, such as the potential for some of this oil to be refined in the United States and used domestically, rather than being exported. Additionally, the statement implies that all the oil transported through the pipeline would be exported, which may not be the case.

## Step 4: Determine the label
Given that the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, it should be labeled as ""mostly false"". This label reflects that while the pipeline would facilitate the transportation of Canadian oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the statement's implication that all of this oil would be exported overlooks the potential for domestic use and simplifies the complex issues surrounding the pipeline's purpose.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Economic Context of 2009
In 2009, the global economy was experiencing a severe recession. The United States, in particular, was facing high levels of unemployment, decreased consumer spending, and a significant decline in economic output. The statement's reference to the economy falling short of its full capacity aligns with the economic conditions of that time.

## Step 4: Assessing the $1 Trillion Shortfall
The claim of a $1 trillion shortfall in the economy's full capacity is substantial. To assess its accuracy, we must consider the economic data from 2009. The U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 2008 was approximately $14.3 trillion, and it decreased in 2009. A $1 trillion shortfall would represent a significant percentage of the GDP, which is plausible given the economic conditions.

## Step 5: Calculating Lost Income for a Family of Four
The statement translates the $1 trillion shortfall into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four. Assuming an average family of four, this calculation can be roughly estimated by dividing the total shortfall by the number of families in the United States. However, without the exact number of families and considering that not all economic losses are evenly distributed, this calculation is an approximation.

However, by 2013, the economy was showing signs of recovery, which could lead to a decrease in the deficit due to increased tax revenues and reduced spending on crisis-related measures.

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the claim
Given the context, the claim that deficits were falling at the fastest rate in 60 years could be plausible if the recovery was strong enough to significantly reduce the deficit. However, without specific data or a comparison to other periods of deficit reduction, it's difficult to assess the claim's accuracy directly.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Barack Obama, who was the President of the United States at the time. As the president, he would have access to detailed economic data and trends, which would inform his statements about the economy.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Given the information available and the context in which the statement was made, without specific data to confirm the rate of deficit reduction, the statement could be seen as accurate based on the economic recovery trends observed around 2013. However, the claim's specificity (""fastest rate in 60 years"") requires detailed historical economic data to fully verify. The statement is likely based on factual trends observed at the time but may lack the nuance needed for a full understanding of the economic situation.

FALSE,Barack Obama,"""Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law.""",11/01/2011,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/nov/03/barack-obama/obama-says-health-law-will-kick-millions-next-year/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that 30 million Americans, including many in Florida, will be able to get healthcare next year because of a law. The key elements are the number of Americans (30 million), the inclusion of people in Florida, and the implication that this is due to a specific law.

## Step 2: Consider the context and the law being referred to
Given the date (11/1/2011) and the source (Barack Obama), it is likely that the law being referred to is the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The ACA aimed to increase healthcare accessibility to more Americans.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on the ACA's provisions and timeline
The ACA had several provisions to increase healthcare accessibility, including the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the prohibition of denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. However, the major provisions, including the health insurance marketplaces and the Medicaid expansion, were set to take effect in 2014, not the next year after the statement (which would be 2012).

## Step 4: Assess the statement's claim about the number of Americans and the timeline
The statement suggests that 30 million Americans would gain healthcare ""next year,"" which, based on the date of the statement, would be 2012. However, the significant expansion of healthcare coverage under the ACA was scheduled for 2014, with the opening of the health insurance marketplaces and the expansion of Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would cover approximately 32 million more Americans by 2019, but this was a longer-term projection, not applicable to the ""next year"" timeframe mentioned.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information and the timeline, the statement appears to be inaccurate regarding the specific year in which 30 million Americans would gain healthcare. The major provisions of the ACA that would lead to significant increases in healthcare coverage were not set to take effect until 2014, making the claim about ""next year"" (2012) misleading.

half-true,Barack Obama,"Obama says his bill ""reduced welfare rolls nearly 80 percent.""",6/30/2008,advertisement,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/jun/30/barack-obama/welfare-rolls-dropped-but-not-just-because-of-law/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the key claim in the statement
The key claim in the statement is that Obama's bill reduced welfare rolls by nearly 80 percent.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on June 30, 2008, by Barack Obama. This was during his presidential campaign, a time when candidates often highlight their achievements.

## Step 3: Evaluate the source of the statement
The source of the statement is Barack Obama himself, which means it could be subject to political spin or bias, but it also suggests that he is taking ownership of the claim.

## Step 4: Assess the claim's plausibility and available data
Without specific data or a reference to a particular bill, it's challenging to verify the claim directly. However, the statement refers to a significant reduction in welfare rolls, which could be related to the welfare reform efforts in the 1990s, such as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, signed into law by President Bill Clinton. This act is known to have led to a substantial decrease in welfare rolls nationwide.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the lack of specific details about which bill Obama is referring to and without direct access to data from 2008 or earlier that confirms his exact role in reducing welfare rolls by 80 percent, the statement's accuracy is difficult to verify. However, it's known that welfare reform efforts in the 1990s did lead to significant reductions in welfare rolls. If Obama's bill contributed to this trend, the statement could be seen as having some basis in fact, but without specifics, it's hard to confirm the exact percentage or the direct impact of his bill.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label based on the analysis
Considering the potential for the statement to be based on real events (welfare reform) but lacking specific details to confirm the 80 percent reduction directly attributed to Obama's bill, the statement seems to be partially accurate but could omit important details or take things out of context.

The key claim in the statement made by Barack Obama on 7/6/2009 is that ""We import more oil today than ever before.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and data available up to 2009
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the historical data on U.S. oil imports up to 2009. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides comprehensive data on oil imports.

## Step 3: Review historical oil import data
According to the EIA, U.S. oil imports did indeed increase significantly over the decades leading up to 2009, with fluctuations due to various factors such as global events, economic conditions, and changes in domestic production.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on 2009 data
As of 2009, the United States was indeed one of the world's largest importers of oil. However, to verify if 2009 marked a peak in oil imports, we need to look at the specific data for that year and compare it with previous years.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement against known data trends
The EIA's data shows that U.S. oil imports peaked in 2005 and then began to decline due to increased domestic production and improvements in fuel efficiency. By 2009, the U.S. was still importing a significant amount of oil, but the total was lower than the peak in 2005.

## Step 6: Conclude the accuracy of the statement
Given that U.S. oil imports peaked in 2005 and had begun to decline by 2009, the statement ""We import more oil today than ever before"" made in 2009 would not be accurate. It does not reflect the decline in oil imports that occurred after 2005.

TRUE,Barack Obama,"""The NRA used to support expanded background checks.""",4/17/2013,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/apr/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-nra-used-support-expanded-backgr/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that the NRA (National Rifle Association) used to support expanded background checks. This requires verifying the historical stance of the NRA on background checks.

## Step 2: Consider the historical context of the NRA's stance on background checks
Historically, the NRA has had varying levels of support for background checks, but it has generally opposed expanded background checks, especially those that could lead to a national registry of gun owners. However, there have been instances where the NRA has supported certain types of background checks, particularly in the aftermath of significant gun violence incidents.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on known facts
In 1999, after the Columbine High School massacre, the NRA did express support for instant background checks at gun shows, which could be seen as a form of expanded background check. However, the organization's overall stance has been more complex, often opposing measures that it perceives as infringing on Second Amendment rights.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the NRA's past expressions of support for certain types of background checks, particularly in specific contexts, the statement that the NRA ""used to support expanded background checks"" can be seen as having some basis in fact. However, the extent and consistency of this support are subject to interpretation and depend on the specific context and time frame considered.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on its accuracy
Considering the nuances in the NRA's historical stance on background checks, the statement is not entirely false but requires clarification. The NRA has shown support for background checks under certain conditions, but its overall position has been more nuanced and context-dependent than a blanket support for ""expanded background checks"" might imply.

The statement made by Barack Obama on 10/25/2011 claims that he has fulfilled about 60 percent of his campaign promises in three years.

## Step 2: Consider the context and timeframe
Given that the statement was made in 2011, and considering Obama's first term in office began in 2009, it's plausible that he had indeed been working on fulfilling his campaign promises for approximately three years.

## Step 3: Evaluate the feasibility of tracking promise fulfillment
Tracking the fulfillment of campaign promises can be complex, as it involves assessing the completion of various policy initiatives, legislative actions, and other commitments made during a campaign. However, organizations and fact-checking entities often undertake this task to hold politicians accountable.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy based on available data
Without specific data or a detailed list of promises and their status at the time of the statement, it's challenging to verify the exact percentage of fulfilled promises. However, fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact have historically tracked Obama's promises and provided assessments of his progress.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the lack of specific details in the statement and the complexity of verifying the fulfillment of campaign promises, the statement could be seen as an overview of progress rather than a precise factual claim. However, without concrete evidence to support or refute the 60 percent figure, and considering that Obama did make significant efforts to fulfill many of his campaign promises during his first term, the statement leans towards being partially accurate but lacks the specificity needed for full verification.

The key claim is that Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military hasn't asked for.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 10/3/2012 by Barack Obama, during a presidential campaign. This context suggests the statement is part of a political debate.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on known facts
Romney's campaign did propose increasing defense spending, but the specifics, such as the amount and whether it was requested by the military, need verification.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of information
Without direct access to Romney's 2012 campaign proposals or statements from the military at that time, it's challenging to verify the exact amount and the military's stance on the proposed increase.

## Step 5: Consider the nature of political statements
Political statements, especially during campaigns, can be subject to interpretation and may not always reflect the full complexity of an issue.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of specific information to directly confirm or deny the $2 trillion figure and the military's request, but acknowledging that Romney did propose increasing defense spending, the statement seems to have a basis in fact but may lack clarity or context.

The statement claims that Barack Obama has cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 9/6/2012, during Barack Obama's presidency. This period is relevant for understanding the policies he implemented.

## Step 3: Evaluate the tax policies implemented by Barack Obama
Barack Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which extended the Bush-era tax cuts for individuals making less than $400,000 and couples making less than $450,000. He also implemented other tax cuts and credits aimed at middle-class families and small businesses, such as the Making Work Pay tax credit and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the tax policies implemented by Barack Obama, it is accurate to say that he cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses. However, the extent and specifics of these cuts might need clarification.

## Step 5: Choose the appropriate label based on the evaluation
Considering the information and the need for some clarification on the specifics of the tax cuts, the statement can be labeled as ""mostly true"". It is accurate but could benefit from additional details about the nature and extent of the tax cuts.

The statement made by Barack Obama on 8/4/2012 claims that Mitt Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.

## Step 2: Verify Mitt Romney's stance on employer-covered contraception
As of the statement's date, Mitt Romney had indeed expressed opposition to the requirement that employers, including those with religious affiliations, must cover contraception as part of their health insurance plans. This was a part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and was a contentious issue during the 2012 presidential campaign.

## Step 3: Verify Mitt Romney's stance on Planned Parenthood funding
Mitt Romney had also stated during his campaign that he would eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, citing his opposition to abortion and the organization's provision of abortion services, among other reasons.

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available up to 8/4/2012, Mitt Romney's public stances on both issues align with the claims made by Barack Obama. Romney did oppose the mandate requiring employers to cover contraception and had expressed his intention to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Since both key components of the statement are supported by Mitt Romney's publicly stated positions as of the date of the statement, the statement is accurate and does not omit critical facts that would alter its truthfulness.

FALSE,Barack Obama,"""The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me.""",5/08/2012,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/may/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-government-job-losses-his-watch-/,mostly true,"## Step 1: Identify the key claim in the statement
The key claim made by Barack Obama is that the only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under his presidency.

## Step 2: Consider historical context and data on government employment during recessions
Historically, government employment has often increased during recessions as a means to stimulate the economy and provide support to those affected by economic downturns. However, the statement specifically claims that government employment has only decreased during a recession under Obama's presidency.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on available data and historical precedent
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other sources indicate that government employment did indeed decline during the recession that occurred during Obama's presidency, which started in 2009. This was partly due to cuts at the state and local levels, as well as a decrease in federal employment in certain sectors.

## Step 4: Consider if there are any exceptions or previous instances where government employment decreased during a recession
While government employment often increases during recessions to support economic recovery, there have been instances where certain levels of government (such as state or local) have reduced employment due to budget constraints. However, the statement's claim about the uniqueness of this occurrence under Obama's presidency needs verification.

## Step 5: Determine the truthfulness of the statement based on the analysis
Given the complexity of government employment trends during recessions and the need for precise historical data, the statement could be seen as an oversimplification. Government employment trends can vary significantly across different levels of government (federal, state, local) and across different recessions. Without comprehensive data showing that no other recession has seen a decrease in government employment, the statement might not fully capture the nuances of historical economic trends.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label based on the analysis
Considering the potential for government employment to decrease in specific contexts during recessions and the lack of comprehensive historical data to support the claim of uniqueness, the statement seems to require clarification or additional information to be fully accurate.

The statement claims that Romney would turn Medicare into a voucher program. This is a specific policy claim made by Barack Obama about his opponent, Mitt Romney, during an election period.

## Step 2: Recall Romney's policy proposals
During his campaign, Mitt Romney proposed changes to Medicare, which included elements of privatization and the use of vouchers or premium support. This would have allowed seniors to use vouchers to purchase private insurance plans rather than relying solely on traditional Medicare.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given Romney's proposals, it is accurate to say that he considered transforming Medicare into a system that included voucher-like elements. However, the term ""voucher program"" might oversimplify the complexity of his proposals, which aimed to introduce market forces into the Medicare system to control costs and improve efficiency.

## Step 4: Consider the context and potential for misinterpretation
The statement could be seen as needing clarification because it does not fully capture the nuances of Romney's plan. Romney's proposal was not simply to replace Medicare with vouchers but to offer seniors a choice between traditional Medicare and private plans, with the government providing financial support for the purchase of these plans.

## Step 5: Determine the label
Given that the statement has a basis in fact but lacks detail and could be misleading without additional context, it should be labeled as ""mostly true."" This reflects that while Romney did propose significant changes to Medicare that included elements similar to a voucher system, the statement simplifies these proposals and might not fully convey the intended structure of the new system.

The key claim is that ""Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on June 29, 2009, by Barack Obama. This context is important for evaluating the accuracy of the claim based on data available up to that point.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on available data and general knowledge
As of 2009, California was known for its energy efficiency policies and initiatives. The state had implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption, such as stricter building codes, incentives for renewable energy, and programs to increase energy efficiency in homes and businesses.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility of the claim
Given California's reputation for environmental policies and energy efficiency efforts, it is plausible that the state could have lower per capita energy consumption compared to the national average.

## Step 5: Consider the need for specific data to verify the claim
To confirm the exact percentage (40 percent less energy per person), specific data from 2009 or the closest available year would be necessary. However, without access to real-time data or specific studies from that period, we must rely on general knowledge and the plausibility of the claim.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the context, the reputation of California for energy efficiency, and without specific data to contradict the claim, the statement seems plausible. However, without exact figures or a source to confirm the ""40 percent"" figure, we cannot definitively label it as ""true."" The claim aligns with the general perception of California's energy consumption patterns but lacks specific verification.

The statement is about the ""accuracy of the Obama tax calculator"" and is attributed to Barack Obama himself, with the date given as 10/14/2008. This was during his presidential campaign.

## Step 2: Consider the nature of a tax calculator
A tax calculator, especially one associated with a political campaign, is a tool designed to estimate how proposed tax policies would affect individuals or families. The accuracy of such a calculator depends on the data it uses, the tax policies it models, and how it applies those policies to individual circumstances.

## Step 3: Evaluate the potential for bias or inaccuracy
Given that the statement comes from Barack Obama during his campaign, there could be a potential for bias or selective presentation of information to support his campaign's tax policies. However, without specific details on what the calculator does or does not account for, it's difficult to assess its accuracy directly.

## Step 4: Consider the date and the context of the campaign
In 2008, tax policies were a significant part of the presidential campaign, with candidates often releasing tools or calculators for voters to see how their policies would affect them. The accuracy of such tools could be crucial for informing voters but also could be subject to political spin.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on available information
Given the lack of specific details about the calculator's methodology, data, or how it models tax policies, and considering the potential for political bias, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without more context. However, the statement itself, ""The accuracy of the Obama tax calculator,"" suggests a claim of accuracy without providing evidence or specifics to support that claim.

The key claim is that wind power is cheaper than dirty fossil fuels in Texas as of the statement's date, 3/12/2016.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data as of 2016
As of 2016, the cost of wind energy had been decreasing significantly due to technological advancements and economies of scale. Texas, being a major producer of wind energy in the United States, had seen substantial investment in wind farms.

## Step 3: Evaluate the cost comparison between wind power and fossil fuels in 2016
Studies and reports from 2016 indicated that the cost of wind energy had reached a point where it was competitive with, if not cheaper than, traditional fossil fuel-based electricity generation in many parts of the United States, including Texas. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for wind power had decreased dramatically, making it a viable alternative.

## Step 4: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Barack Obama, the President of the United States at the time, who had been a proponent of renewable energy and had access to detailed reports and data on energy costs and trends.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on the available information
Given the decreasing costs of wind energy, its competitiveness with fossil fuels, and the specific mention of Texas, which is a leading state in wind energy production, the statement appears to be supported by the trends and data available as of 2016.

In 2000, before Bush took office, there were approximately 39.8 million people without health insurance. By 2007, this number had increased to about 45.7 million.

## Step 2: Evaluate the statement about children in poverty since George Bush took office.
Data from the U.S. Census Bureau also indicates that the child poverty rate increased during Bush's presidency. In 2000, the child poverty rate was about 16.2%, and by 2007, it had increased to about 18.0%.

## Step 3: Consider the context and accuracy of the statement.
Given the data from reputable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, both parts of the statement made by Barack Obama on April 18, 2008, are supported by factual evidence.

The statement claims that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is helping to slow the growth of Medicare's health care costs, as of the date 2/12/2013, and it is attributed to Barack Obama.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data up to 2013
As of 2013, the Affordable Care Act had been in effect for a few years, and there were initial reports and studies on its impact on health care costs. The ACA included several provisions aimed at reducing the growth rate of health care spending, such as changes in payment structures, investments in preventive care, and efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency.

## Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the ACA on Medicare costs
Studies and data up to 2013 suggested that the ACA was indeed contributing to a slowdown in the growth rate of health care costs, including those associated with Medicare. This was partly due to provisions like the reduction in the growth rate of Medicare payments to providers and the introduction of accountable care organizations (ACOs) aimed at improving efficiency and quality of care.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy based on available evidence
Given the information available up to 2013, there was evidence to support the claim that the ACA was helping to slow the growth of health care costs, including those related to Medicare. This evidence included reports from the Medicare Trustees, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and other health care research organizations.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Based on the evidence and context available up to 2013, the statement that the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of Medicare's health care costs can be considered accurate. The statement aligns with the data and analyses available at the time, indicating a slowdown in the growth rate of health care costs due to the ACA's provisions.

The statement claims that in March, New Jersey was one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs and was the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation.

## Step 2: Determine the source of the statement
The statement is attributed to Barbara Buono, but to verify its accuracy, we would need to consult data from a reliable source such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the specific month and year mentioned (March 2012).

## Step 3: Consider the context and potential for bias
Given that the statement is from a political figure, Barbara Buono, there might be a political context or motivation behind the statement. However, without more information about her position or the context in which the statement was made, we cannot assume bias.

## Step 4: Evaluate the availability of data
The BLS does provide monthly employment data by state, which would include job gains and losses. This data would be crucial in verifying the statement's accuracy.

## Step 5: Assess the statement based on available data
Without direct access to the BLS data for March 2012 at this moment, we cannot immediately confirm the statement's accuracy. However, the process of verification would involve checking if New Jersey indeed had the highest job loss among all states in March 2012 and if it was among the few states to experience job loss during that period.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on the process of verification
Given the lack of immediate access to specific BLS data for March 2012 and without further information that could clarify or contradict the statement, we cannot definitively label the statement as true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, or false based solely on the information provided.

The statement claims that Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state and gave away its nuclear arms with the understanding that the speaker's country (implied to be the United States or its allies) would protect them.

## Step 2: Verify the historical context of Ukraine's nuclear status
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine indeed inherited a significant nuclear arsenal, making it the third-largest nuclear power in the world at the time.

## Step 3: Confirm the agreement regarding the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine
Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons through the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, signed on December 5, 1994. This memorandum was signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The agreement provided assurances to Ukraine regarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity in exchange for its nuclear disarmament.

## Step 4: Evaluate the protection aspect of the agreement
The Budapest Memorandum did include assurances that the signatory countries would respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and existing borders, and would refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine. However, it did not explicitly guarantee military protection in the event of an attack.

## Step 5: Assess the accuracy of the statement
Given the historical context and the terms of the Budapest Memorandum, the statement that Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state and gave away its nuclear arms with the understanding that it would be protected is partially accurate. The memorandum did provide security assurances, but the nature of these assurances is more nuanced than a straightforward guarantee of protection.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the information provided and the nuances of the Budapest Memorandum, the statement is not entirely accurate in its implication of a direct protection guarantee. However, it does capture the essence of Ukraine's decision to disarm in exchange for security assurances.

Today we are in 12th place.""",12/05/2014,social_media,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/dec/05/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-us-was-1st-college-degrees-199/,mostly true,"## Step 1: Identify the key claim of the statement
The statement claims that in 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees, but by the time of the statement (2014), the U.S. had fallen to 12th place.

## Step 2: Consider the source and date of the statement
The statement was made by Bernie Sanders on 12/5/2014. Bernie Sanders is a U.S. politician known for his progressive policies, and his statements often reflect concerns about economic and educational inequalities.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available data and research on the topic
According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in 1990, the United States indeed had one of the highest percentages of young adults (25-34 years old) with tertiary education. However, by 2014, several countries had surpassed the U.S. in this metric.

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the statement
Given the OECD data, it is plausible that the U.S. was in a leading position in 1990 but had fallen behind other countries by 2014. The specific ranking of 12th place needs verification, but the general trend of the statement aligns with observed changes in global educational attainment rankings.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the information available and the general trend observed in educational attainment rankings, the statement appears to be accurate in its general claim that the U.S. has fallen behind in the percentage of young adults with college degrees. However, without the exact OECD data from 1990 and 2014 to confirm the 12th place ranking, the statement might be considered mostly true, as it reflects a real trend but may require clarification on the exact ranking.

The statement claims that in 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income, which is more than the entire bottom 50 percent.

## Step 2: Consider the source and date of the statement
The statement was made by Bernie Sanders on 11/30/2010. Given the date, we need to verify if the data from 2007 supports this claim.

## Step 3: Recall or research the relevant economic data from 2007
According to data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in 2007, the top 1% of earners in the United States did indeed hold a significant portion of the national income. The exact figures may vary slightly depending on the source, but it is well-documented that income inequality in the United States has been increasing over the years.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim based on known economic data and trends
Studies and reports from around that time, including those from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) and other economic research organizations, have shown that the top 1% of income earners in the U.S. have seen their share of national income increase substantially since the 1970s. The claim that the top 1% made more than the bottom 50% in 2007 aligns with trends of increasing income inequality.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the known trends in income inequality and the specific data from 2007, the statement appears to be supported by factual evidence. The top 1% of income earners did indeed make a significant portion of the national income, and it is plausible that their share exceeded that of the bottom 50%.

The statement was made by Bernie Sanders on May 1, 2016, regarding the possibility of winning enough pledged delegates.

## Step 2: Consider the political context of the time
In 2016, Bernie Sanders was running for the Democratic presidential nomination against Hillary Clinton. The nomination process involves winning delegates in each state, with a certain number needed to secure the nomination.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on the information available at the time
Given the date of the statement (May 1, 2016), we need to consider the state of the Democratic primary race at that time. By May 2016, a significant number of primaries and caucuses had already taken place, and Hillary Clinton was leading in the count of pledged delegates.

## Step 4: Determine the feasibility of Sanders' statement
Despite Clinton's lead, it was still mathematically possible for Sanders to win enough delegates to catch up, especially if he performed very well in the remaining contests. However, the likelihood of this happening was considered low by many analysts at the time.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on its accuracy and context
Given that it was not impossible for Sanders to win enough pledged delegates at the time of the statement, but acknowledging the challenging nature of this task, the statement can be considered accurate in a mathematical sense but overly optimistic in terms of practical political analysis.

The statement made by Bernie Sanders on 4/15/2016 claims that when his campaign began, he advocated for raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15, while Secretary Clinton proposed raising it to $12.

## Step 2: Verify the initial minimum wage claim
The federal minimum wage in the United States was indeed $7.25 at the time of the statement, which is a verifiable fact.

## Step 3: Research Bernie Sanders' minimum wage proposal
Bernie Sanders did propose raising the minimum wage to $15 during his campaign, which aligns with his statement.

## Step 4: Research Secretary Clinton's minimum wage proposal
Secretary Clinton's proposal during her campaign was to raise the minimum wage to $12, not $15, which also aligns with Sanders' statement about her position.

## Step 5: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given that both the initial minimum wage, Sanders' proposal, and Clinton's proposal as stated by Sanders are accurate, the statement is factually correct.

## Step 6: Consider the context and potential for missing information
The statement is specific to the minimum wage proposals of Bernie Sanders and Secretary Clinton during their campaigns. It does not claim to represent their entire economic policies or any changes in their positions over time, so it does not omit critical information necessary for understanding the claim made.

The statement made by Bernie Sanders on 9/25/2013 claims that Texas Republicans believe in abolishing Social Security and V.A. health care.

## Step 2: Assess the context and potential evidence
To evaluate the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the political context of the time, the stance of Texas Republicans on these issues, and any public statements or policy proposals they may have made regarding Social Security and V.A. health care.

## Step 3: Consider the political climate and known positions
In 2013, discussions around entitlement reform and healthcare were prominent. Some Republicans had proposed reforms to Social Security and healthcare systems, but these did not necessarily equate to abolishing them. The statement's broad claim about abolishing these programs needs to be scrutinized against actual policy proposals and statements from Texas Republicans.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement for accuracy
Given the broad nature of the statement and without specific evidence of Texas Republicans collectively advocating for the abolition of Social Security and V.A. health care, the claim appears to be an exaggeration. While some Republicans may have suggested reforms or privatization options for these programs, equating this with a belief in abolishing them may not accurately represent the views of all Texas Republicans.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the evaluation
Considering the lack of specific evidence supporting the claim that Texas Republicans as a whole believe in abolishing these programs, and acknowledging that some form of reform discussions were ongoing, the statement seems to omit important nuances and details about the actual positions of Texas Republicans.

The key claim is that less than 10 percent of the defense budget goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on January 17, 2016, by Bernie Sanders. This context is important for understanding the budget and military operations at that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available data on defense budget allocation
As of 2016, the U.S. defense budget was allocated across various sectors, including operations against ISIS and international terrorism. However, the exact percentage allocated specifically to fighting ISIS and international terrorism can vary and might not be publicly disclosed in detail.

## Step 4: Assess the general allocation of the U.S. defense budget
The U.S. defense budget is vast and covers a wide range of activities, including personnel, equipment, maintenance, and operations across the globe. The portion dedicated to specific counter-terrorism operations like those against ISIS would be a subset of the overall budget.

## Step 5: Consider the complexity of budget allocations
Budget allocations can be complex, with funds often being allocated to broader categories (e.g., ""Overseas Contingency Operations"") that encompass multiple missions, including but not limited to counter-terrorism efforts against ISIS.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on available information
Given the complexity of defense budget allocations and the specificity of the claim (less than 10 percent), without exact figures from 2016 that detail the allocation specifically to fighting ISIS and international terrorism, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as true or false. However, considering the broad nature of budget allocations and the fact that counter-terrorism efforts are a significant but not the sole focus of the U.S. military, the statement might oversimplify the budget's complexity.

## Step 7: Choose the appropriate label
Given the potential for the statement to be an oversimplification and lacking specific, publicly available data to confirm the exact percentage allocated to fighting ISIS and international terrorism as of 2016, the statement is likely not entirely accurate but may contain an element of truth. It does not provide a clear, nuanced view of the budget allocation.

The statement claims that less than 10 percent of the total U.S. military budget is used to fight international terrorism, as stated by Bernie Sanders on November 14, 2015.

## Step 2: Contextualizing the Statement
To assess the accuracy of the statement, it's essential to consider the context of the U.S. military budget and how it is allocated. The U.S. military budget is vast and encompasses a wide range of expenditures, including personnel, equipment, operations, and maintenance, across various branches and departments.

## Step 3: Analyzing Budget Allocation
The allocation of the U.S. military budget to fight international terrorism would include expenses related to operations in areas like the Middle East, drone strikes, special operations, and intelligence gathering, among others. However, the budget for these specific activities is often not transparently separated from the overall budget, making direct percentage calculations challenging.

## Step 4: Considering the Time Frame
The statement was made in 2015, a time when the U.S. was involved in several military operations, including those against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and ongoing operations in Afghanistan. The budget for these operations would be a significant portion of the overall military expenditure but might not exceed 10% when considering the entire military budget, which includes costs for personnel, bases, research, and development, among other things.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement
Given the complexity of the U.S. military budget and the lack of detailed, publicly available breakdowns of expenditures specifically for fighting international terrorism, it's difficult to definitively label the statement as true or false without specific data. However, considering the broad scope of military spending, it's plausible that direct expenditures on counter-terrorism operations could be less than 10% of the total budget, especially when including all other military expenditures.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement seems to have a basis in reality, given the vast and varied nature of U.S. military spending. However, without precise figures or a detailed breakdown of the budget specifically allocated to fighting international terrorism, the statement lacks concrete evidence to fully support it. Thus, it might be considered mostly true, as it reflects a plausible allocation scenario but lacks the specificity needed for absolute confirmation.

The key claim is that the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the population owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 7/25/2016 by Bernie Sanders. This context suggests the statement is related to economic inequality in the United States around that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on known economic data and research
Research and data from around 2016, such as that from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) and other economic studies, have shown significant wealth inequality in the United States. Specifically, studies have indicated that the wealthiest fraction of the population holds a disproportionate amount of the country's wealth.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the known wealth inequality in the United States and the trend of increasing wealth concentration among the very rich, the statement that the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent aligns with the general findings of economic research from that period.

## Step 5: Consider if the statement needs clarification or additional information
While the statement is broadly accurate based on the trend of wealth inequality, the exact figures can vary depending on the source and methodology used. However, the core claim about significant wealth disparity is supported by various studies and data.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given the support from economic research and data indicating significant wealth inequality, the statement can be considered accurate but may benefit from additional context or clarification regarding the specific data sources and methodologies used to arrive at the ""almost as much wealth"" comparison.

The key claim is that Texas ranks 50th in the nation in terms of mental health care access.

## Step 2: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on May 25, 2022. This is important because rankings can change over time due to various factors such as policy changes, funding allocations, and shifts in population needs.

## Step 3: Evaluate the source of the statement
The source is Beto O'Rourke, a political figure. Political figures may use data to support their arguments, but it's also possible for them to present information in a way that supports their political stance.

## Step 4: Assess the claim's accuracy based on available data up to the statement's date
As of my last update, specific rankings can vary depending on the criteria used (e.g., access to care, quality of care, funding). However, without the most current or specific data from reputable sources like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or other health care access reports from 2022, it's challenging to definitively confirm Texas's ranking.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential for missing information
The statement lacks specificity regarding the criteria used for the ranking (e.g., access, quality, funding). Mental health care access can be measured in various ways, including the number of mental health professionals per capita, insurance coverage, and wait times for appointments.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis

pants-fire,Bill O'Reilly,"""We researched to find out if anybody on Fox News had ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance.

The key claim made by Bill O'Reilly is that nobody on Fox News had ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance.

## Step 2: Consider the context and timing of the statement
The statement was made on April 13, 2010. This is around the time when the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was being discussed and implemented. The ACA included a provision that required individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty, which was a topic of much debate.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on known facts
It is known that some commentators on Fox News did suggest that people could go to jail for not paying the penalty associated with not having health insurance under the ACA. However, the specific claim that nobody on Fox News ever said this needs to be verified against actual statements made by Fox News personalities around that time.

## Step 4: Recall specific instances or statements made by Fox News personalities
There were instances where Fox News personalities suggested that failure to pay the penalty for not having health insurance could result in jail time, although these claims were often based on misunderstandings of the law. For example, some argued that the IRS could pursue legal action, including jail time, for unpaid taxes, which could theoretically include the penalty for not having health insurance. However, the ACA specifically prohibited the IRS from using liens or levies to collect the penalty, and jail time was not a provision for non-payment of the penalty itself.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available, it appears that some Fox News personalities did make statements suggesting that not buying health insurance could lead to jail time, albeit often in a misleading or exaggerated manner. Therefore, Bill O'Reilly's statement that nobody on Fox News had ever said this is not accurate.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement made by Bill O'Reilly is not accurate because there were instances where Fox News personalities suggested a link between not buying health insurance and potential jail time, even if the legal basis for such claims was flawed or exaggerated.

The statement claims that among Hispanics, support for immigration reform is close to universal, as stated by Bill Richardson on 5/5/2013.

## Step 2: Considering the Context and Date
Given the date of the statement (5/5/2013), it's essential to consider the context of immigration reform discussions around that time. In 2013, there were significant efforts and debates about comprehensive immigration reform in the United States.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Source
Bill Richardson, the source of the statement, is a former Governor of New Mexico and has been involved in various political and diplomatic efforts, including those related to Hispanic issues and immigration. His perspective might reflect a level of insight into Hispanic opinions on immigration reform.

## Step 4: Assessing the Universality of Support
The term ""close to universal"" implies a very high level of support among Hispanics for immigration reform. While it's known that many Hispanics support immigration reform due to its potential impact on family members, friends, and community, the extent of this support can vary based on specific aspects of reform, such as pathways to citizenship, border security, and enforcement policies.

## Step 5: Fact-Checking the Statement
Research and polls from around 2013 showed that a significant majority of Hispanics did indeed support immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. However, the term ""close to universal"" might overstate the level of consensus, as opinions can vary widely within the Hispanic community based on factors like country of origin, length of time in the U.S., and personal experiences with immigration policies.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the information available and considering the context of the time, while there was significant support among Hispanics for immigration reform, stating that support is ""close to universal"" might not fully capture the nuances and variations within the community's opinions. Therefore, the statement is mostly true but could benefit from clarification regarding the diversity of views within the Hispanic community.

The statement claims that most of Perry's chiefs of staff have been lobbyists. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to consider the historical context and the available data on Perry's chiefs of staff and their backgrounds.

## Step 2: Consider the source and date of the statement
The statement was made by Bill White on 8/14/2010. Bill White was a political opponent of Rick Perry, which might introduce a bias in the statement. However, the date and source suggest that the statement was made during a political campaign, which could imply that the claim was subject to some level of scrutiny or fact-checking by the media or opposing campaigns.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available information on Perry's chiefs of staff
Without specific data on each of Perry's chiefs of staff and their professional backgrounds, it's challenging to directly verify the statement. However, if most of Perry's chiefs of staff indeed had lobbying backgrounds, this would be a matter of public record and potentially reported by media outlets or tracked by government transparency groups.

## Step 4: Consider the implications of the statement
If true, the statement could imply a close relationship between Perry's administration and the lobbying community, which might be seen as controversial. The truthfulness of the statement would depend on the actual number of chiefs of staff who were lobbyists and the context in which they served.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the available information
Given the lack of specific details to directly confirm or deny the statement and considering the potential for the statement to be scrutinized during a political campaign, the most appropriate approach is to consider the statement as potentially true but lacking concrete evidence to fully support it without further investigation.

The key claim is that ""Our families have the highest property taxes in the country.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/15/2017 by Bruce Rauner. This context is important for evaluating the claim as property tax rates can change over time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on available data up to 2017
As of 2017, various reports and studies indicated that Illinois, where Bruce Rauner was the governor, indeed had some of the highest property taxes in the United States. This was due to a combination of factors including high local government spending, the state's pension crisis, and the reliance on property taxes to fund schools and local services.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the claim
Given the information available up to 2017, it is accurate to say that Illinois had among the highest property taxes in the country. However, the claim that they are the ""highest"" might need clarification because property tax rates can vary significantly within a state, and other states might have specific areas or circumstances with even higher effective tax rates.

## Step 5: Choose the appropriate label based on the evaluation
Considering the information and the need for slight clarification regarding the variability of property taxes within states and the possibility of other areas having higher rates under specific circumstances, the statement is mostly true.

The key claim in the statement is that Carly Fiorina doubled the size of Hewlett-Packard (HP) during her tenure.

## Step 2: Consider the context and timeframe of the statement
The statement was made on May 10, 2015. Carly Fiorina was the CEO of HP from 1999 to 2005. To assess the claim, we need to look at the company's size, typically measured by revenue or number of employees, at the beginning and end of her tenure.

## Step 3: Evaluate the growth of HP under Carly Fiorina's leadership
During Fiorina's tenure, HP acquired Compaq in 2002, which significantly increased the company's size in terms of revenue and employees. Before the acquisition, HP had about 84,400 employees and $48.8 billion in revenue (fiscal year 2001). After the acquisition, by 2004, HP had around 150,000 employees and $79.9 billion in revenue.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the significant increase in both revenue and the number of employees following the Compaq acquisition, it can be said that the size of the company roughly doubled under Fiorina's leadership. However, the exact timing and the method of measuring ""size"" (revenue vs. employees) could affect the precise calculation.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Considering the significant growth due to the Compaq acquisition and the general increase in size, the statement can be considered accurate but might need some clarification on how ""size"" is defined. However, given the context, it's reasonable to interpret the statement as referring to the substantial growth achieved through the acquisition.

The statement claims that the State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and Hillary Clinton is the only one who has done it.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/8/2015 by Charles Schumer. This date is important because it was during a time when Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State was under scrutiny.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
As of the statement's date, it was known that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server and had provided her emails to the State Department. However, the claim that she was the ""only one"" to have done so might be misleading or inaccurate without further context, such as how the request was made and to whom, and what the response was from other secretaries of state.

## Step 4: Determine the label for the statement
Given the potential for the statement to be misleading or incomplete, and considering that the full context of the State Department's request and the responses from other secretaries of state are not provided, the statement cannot be labeled as entirely true without further clarification.

The statement claims that Jeb Bush, not Charlie Crist, signed legislation allowing Duke Energy to collect money for nuclear projects.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential biases
The statement is made by Charlie Crist, who is likely to have a political motivation for making this claim, especially given the date (10/15/2014) which could be close to an election.

## Step 3: Evaluate the factual basis of the statement
Without specific details on the legislation or the date it was signed, it's difficult to immediately verify the claim. However, the statement can be checked against historical records of legislation signed by Jeb Bush during his tenure as Governor of Florida (1999-2007) and comparing it with Charlie Crist's tenure (2007-2011).

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given that the statement specifies Jeb Bush and not Charlie Crist signed the legislation, and considering that such specific actions are a matter of public record, the statement could be verifiable. If records show that Jeb Bush indeed signed legislation allowing Duke Energy to collect money for nuclear projects, and Charlie Crist did not, the statement would be accurate.

## Step 5: Consider the implications of the statement's date and source
The date (10/15/2014) suggests the statement might be related to an election campaign, potentially the 2014 Florida gubernatorial election, where Charlie Crist was a candidate. This context implies the statement could be used to differentiate Crist's policies or actions from those of his opponents or predecessors.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Without direct access to the specific legislation or records at this moment, but understanding the political context and the nature of such claims, the statement's accuracy hinges on verifiable historical records of legislative actions by Jeb Bush and Charlie Crist.

TRUE,Charlie Crist,"""In the mid 1990s, in our state, (Florida was) No. 1 in violent crime in America. ... The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds.""",9/19/2016,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/sep/20/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-florida-was-no-1-violent-crime/,TRUE,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that in the mid-1990s, Florida was No. 1 in violent crime in America, and that a violent crime occurred every 3 minutes and 45 seconds.

## Step 2: Verify the ranking of Florida in violent crime
According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which collects and analyzes crime data from law enforcement agencies across the United States, Florida did experience high rates of violent crime in the 1990s. However, without specific data for the mid-1990s, it's difficult to confirm if Florida was indeed ranked No. 1 in violent crime.

## Step 3: Examine the frequency of violent crimes
The claim that a violent crime occurred every 3 minutes and 45 seconds in Florida during the mid-1990s requires specific crime data to verify. This frequency would depend on the total number of violent crimes reported in Florida during that period and the state's population.

## Step 4: Consider the source and context
Charlie Crist, the source of the statement, was a public figure in Florida, serving as Governor from 2007 to 2011 and previously as Attorney General. His statement might be based on data available to him during his tenure or from his experience in law enforcement and politics.

## Step 5: Evaluate the availability of data
The FBI's UCR data for the 1990s does show that Florida had high crime rates. For example, in 1995, Florida reported a violent crime rate of 1,017.4 per 100,000 inhabitants, which was one of the highest in the nation. However, without the exact ranking for every state for each year of the mid-1990s, it's challenging to confirm Florida's No. 1 position.

## Step 6: Assess the statement's accuracy
Given the lack of specific data to confirm both the ranking and the frequency of violent crimes, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true without further evidence. However, it is known that Florida did experience high levels of violent crime in the 1990s.

## Step 7: Determine the label
Considering the information available and the context in which the statement was made, the statement seems to be based on a factual foundation but lacks specific details to fully confirm its accuracy. Therefore, it should be labeled as ""half true"" because it is partially",D,crime,10000-50000

The statement claims that the graduation rate is the highest it has ever been, as stated by Charlie Crist on 3/2/2010.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential for verification
Given the date and the source, we need to consider if there's a way to verify this claim. Graduation rates can be tracked over time and are typically reported by educational institutions or government agencies.

## Step 3: Evaluate the possibility of the statement being true
Without specific data or a reference to a particular institution or region, it's difficult to immediately verify the claim. However, it's plausible that Charlie Crist, presumably in a position of authority or knowledge, could have access to such information.

## Step 4: Consider the need for additional information
The statement lacks specificity regarding which graduation rate is being referred to (e.g., high school, college, a specific state or country). This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim without further context.

## Step 5: Assess the potential for the statement to be misleading
Without knowing the specific context or the source of the data, there's a risk that the statement could be misleading or not entirely accurate. It might refer to a specific subset of data that is not representative of the broader situation.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the lack of specificity and the potential for the statement to be accurate but lacking in detail, the most appropriate label seems to be ""half true."" This is because the statement could be accurate in a specific context but omits important details necessary for a full understanding of its validity.

The key claim is that Florida was ranked 2nd in the nation in long-term unemployment, which is attributed to Rick Scott's record on jobs.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on April 25, 2014, by Charlie Crist. This context suggests the statement is related to a political campaign or critique of Rick Scott's governance.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of data on long-term unemployment
Long-term unemployment data is typically tracked by government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS provides monthly and annual data on unemployment rates, including long-term unemployment.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility of the statement
Given that long-term unemployment rates can fluctuate and vary significantly by state, it's plausible that Florida could have been ranked high in long-term unemployment at some point. However, without specific data from 2014 or the period leading up to it, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement directly.

## Step 5: Consider the potential for political bias
The statement is made by Charlie Crist, a political opponent of Rick Scott, which introduces the potential for bias or selective presentation of facts to criticize Scott's record.

## Step 6: Determine the need for additional information
To accurately label the statement, specific data on Florida's long-term unemployment rate ranking in 2014 or the relevant period is necessary. Without access to this data or a clear indication that the statement has been fact-checked against reliable sources, the statement's accuracy cannot be definitively determined.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on available information
Given the lack of specific data to confirm or deny the statement and considering the potential for political bias, the statement cannot be labeled as true or false without further information. However, the statement does not seem to be implausible or entirely detached from reality, as it discusses a measurable economic indicator.

FALSE,Chris Christie,"""For a young man or woman who is entering the ninth grade in Newark this year, they have a 29 percent graduation rate.""",4/29/2011,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/jun/15/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-graduation-rate-29-percent/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the key components of the statement
The statement claims that for a young man or woman entering the ninth grade in Newark in 2011, they have a 29 percent graduation rate. This statement is attributed to Chris Christie and was made on 4/29/2011.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
To assess the accuracy of the statement, we need to consider the graduation rates in Newark around the time the statement was made. The statement specifically mentions the graduation rate for students entering the ninth grade, implying it refers to the four-year graduation rate for the class of 2015, since they would be entering 9th grade in 2011.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available data on graduation rates
According to various reports and studies on education, the graduation rates in urban areas like Newark, New Jersey, have historically been lower compared to national averages. However, without specific data from 2011 or the subsequent years to confirm the exact graduation rate of students who entered 9th grade in Newark in 2011, it's challenging to directly verify the 29 percent claim.

## Step 4: Consider the source and potential biases
Chris Christie, as a public figure, especially as the Governor of New Jersey at the time, would have access to educational data. However, political figures may also use statistics to support their policies or viewpoints, which could introduce bias.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of specific, confirmatory data from 2011 and considering that graduation rates can fluctuate, the statement's accuracy cannot be definitively confirmed without more detailed information. However, it's also important to recognize that urban areas like Newark have faced challenges with graduation rates. Without explicit evidence to refute or confirm the 29 percent figure, and acknowledging the potential for political context to influence the presentation of statistics, the statement should be approached with caution.

The statement made by Chris Christie on June 26, 2012, claims that state Sen. Paul Sarlo said there would be no tax increases in the budget during an NJTV appearance in February, but then voted to raise income taxes by $800 million in the Senate Budget Committee.

## Step 2: Determine the accuracy of the statement
To label the statement, we need to verify if Sen. Paul Sarlo indeed made the statement about no tax increases and if he later voted for a tax increase. Without direct access to the NJTV recording or the Senate Budget Committee's voting records from that time, we must consider the context and potential for political rhetoric.

## Step 3: Consider the context and potential for political spin
Given that the statement is made by a political figure (Chris Christie) about another political figure (Paul Sarlo), there's a potential for spin or selective presentation of facts. Political statements often require careful examination to separate fact from rhetoric.

## Step 4: Evaluate the possibility of missing context or details
The statement might be missing context about the conditions under which Sen. Sarlo made his initial statement or the specifics of the vote in the Senate Budget Committee. Political decisions and statements can be complex, with many factors influencing them.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the available information
Given the potential for political spin, the lack of direct evidence to support or refute the claim, and the complexity of political decision-making, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without more information.

The key claim is that private-sector job growth in 2011 places New Jersey in the top third among all states.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on February 21, 2012, which means the data being referred to is from 2011. This is important because economic data can vary significantly from year to year.

## Step 3: Evaluate the source of the statement
The statement comes from Chris Christie, who at the time was the Governor of New Jersey. As a political figure, his statements may be subject to political spin, but as the governor, he would also have access to detailed economic data for his state.

## Step 4: Assess the claim based on available data
Without specific data provided in the statement, we must consider how job growth is typically measured and reported. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a primary source for employment data in the United States. According to the BLS, job growth can be measured in various ways, including the change in the number of jobs from one year to the next.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the claim
Given that the statement lacks specific numbers and considering that economic rankings can vary depending on the source and methodology used, it's challenging to verify the claim without direct access to the 2011 job growth data for all states. However, if New Jersey experienced significant private-sector job growth in 2011 compared to other states, it could potentially place in the top third.

## Step 6: Consider potential biases or missing information
The statement could be subject to political bias, as it was made by a governor who might have an interest in presenting his state's economic performance in a positive light. Additionally, the statement does not provide a clear definition of ""top third"" or how the ranking was determined.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the criteria
Given the lack of specific data and potential for political spin, but also considering that the statement could be based on real economic data, the most appropriate label would be ""half true.""

As of 2012, the New York Giants trained at the Timex Performance Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This part of the statement is true.

## Step 3: Verify the playing location of the New York Giants as of 2012
As of 2012, the New York Giants played their home games at MetLife Stadium (previously known as New Meadowlands Stadium), which is located in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This part of the statement is true.

## Step 4: Verify the residential location of most New York Giants players as of 2012
While the exact residences of all players might not be publicly known, it is common for many NFL players to live in or near the state where their team is based, especially considering the team's facilities and stadium are in New Jersey. However, without specific data, this claim is harder to verify as entirely accurate for ""most"" players.

## Step 5: Consider the overall accuracy of the statement
Given that the team does indeed train and play in New Jersey, and acknowledging that while many players might live in New Jersey, the claim about ""most of their players"" living in New Jersey lacks concrete evidence but is plausible, the statement is largely accurate but could benefit from clarification on the player residences.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement based on the analysis
Considering the steps above, the statement is mostly accurate but needs some clarification regarding the residential aspect of the players.

The statement claims that the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a bill that denies veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential implications
The statement implies that the bill directly targets veterans' benefits, specifically those related to medical costs for cancers developed during service. This could have significant implications for how veterans are treated and supported.

## Step 3: Evaluate the source of the statement
The source of the statement is Chris Larson, but without additional context about who Chris Larson is or his position, it's difficult to assess the credibility of the statement based solely on the source.

The statement claims that nobody applies to the United States for refugee status directly; instead, they apply to the United Nations. This implies a process where the UN is the primary point of contact for refugee status applications, which are then possibly referred to countries like the United States.

## Step 2: Refugee Application Process
The process for seeking refugee status typically involves applying for protection with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) if the individual is outside their home country. The UNHCR then works with governments, including the U.S. government, to resettle refugees. However, the U.S. also has its own process for asylum seekers who are already within the country or at its borders, which does not necessarily involve the UN as the first point of contact.

## Step 3: Direct Application to the United States
Individuals can apply for asylum directly with U.S. authorities if they are already in the United States or at a U.S. port of entry. This process does not require an initial application to the United Nations. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) are involved in this process.

## Step 4: Evaluating the Statement
Given the information, the statement is not entirely accurate. While it is true that many refugees apply for protection through the UNHCR, it is not true that ""nobody"" applies directly to the United States for refugee status, especially considering asylum seekers who are already in the U.S. or at its borders.

## Step 5: Conclusion
The statement contains an element of truth in that many refugees do apply through the UNHCR, but it ignores the critical fact that direct applications to the U.S. for asylum are also possible and a significant part of the refugee and asylum process.

The statement comes from Connie Mack, who is likely promoting his own plan, the Mack Penny Plan, for the federal budget. This could indicate a potential bias in the statement.

## Step 2: Consider the date of the statement
The statement was made on 5/9/2012. Budget projections and support for plans can change over time due to various factors, including economic conditions and political shifts.

## Step 3: Assess the claim about balancing the budget
The claim that the Mack Penny Plan would balance the federal budget by 2019 is a specific prediction that can be verified by looking at the actual budget outcomes for 2019 and the plan's details. However, without access to real-time data or the plan's specifics as of the statement's date, we must consider the nature of budget projections and the challenges in predicting economic and political outcomes years in advance.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim of gaining support
The statement that the plan ""continues to gain support"" is subjective and can be influenced by political rhetoric. Support for a budget plan can fluctuate based on various factors, including political campaigns, economic conditions, and public opinion.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the potential for bias, the challenge in predicting future budget outcomes, and the subjective nature of ""gaining support,"" the statement lacks concrete, verifiable evidence to fully support its claims as of the statement's date.

## Step 6: Label the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement is partially accurate in that it reflects a proposal and potentially some level of support at the time.

The key claim is that ""Farmer suicide rates are as high as they have been since the Great Depression.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/18/2019 by Cory Booker. This context is important for understanding the relevance and accuracy of the claim at that specific time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available data on farmer suicide rates
Research indicates that farmer suicide rates have indeed been high in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the occupational group with the highest suicide rate in 2016 was farming, fishing, and forestry, with a rate of 84.5 per 100,000 workers. This is significantly higher than the overall rate for all occupations, which was 18.0 per 100,000 workers.

## Step 4: Compare with historical data from the Great Depression
Historical data on suicide rates, especially specific to farmers during the Great Depression, is less readily available and may not be directly comparable due to differences in data collection and reporting over time. However, it is known that the Great Depression was a period of significant economic hardship that affected farmers particularly severely, which could imply high levels of distress and potentially high suicide rates.

## Step 5: Assess the statement's accuracy based on available information
Given the high rates of farmer suicides in recent years and considering the historical context of the Great Depression, the statement that farmer suicide rates are as high as they have been since the Great Depression could be seen as having some basis in fact. However, without direct, comparable historical data, it's challenging to confirm the statement's absolute accuracy.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the high current rates of farmer suicides and the known hardships of the Great Depression, but also acknowledging the lack of directly comparable historical data, the statement seems to be partially accurate but may lack the nuance needed for a full understanding of the issue.

The statement claims that ""Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool"" under the new health care law. This statement was made by Crossroads GPS on 5/16/2012.

## Step 2: Consider the context of the statement
Given the date of the statement (5/16/2012), it is likely referring to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was passed in 2010 and was being implemented around that time. The ACA aimed to increase health insurance quality and affordability, lower the uninsured rate by expanding insurance coverage, and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government.

## Step 3: Evaluate the potential impact of the ACA on health care coverage
The ACA introduced several provisions, including the expansion of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance marketplaces, and the requirement for individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty (the individual mandate). While these provisions aimed to increase health insurance coverage, there were concerns about potential disruptions, such as the possibility of some individuals losing their existing coverage if their employers decided to drop their group plans or if certain plans did not meet the new standards set by the ACA.

## Step 4: Assess the claim about being ""forced into a government pool""
The term ""government pool"" could refer to Medicaid or the health insurance marketplaces created by the ACA. The law did expand Medicaid to cover more low-income individuals, and it created the marketplaces where people could buy insurance, often with subsidies. However, the idea that millions would be ""forced"" into these options might be misleading, as the law also allowed for the continuation of existing coverage and the purchase of insurance through employers or directly from insurers.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Considering the potential for some individuals to lose their existing health care coverage due to changes in the health care market or employer decisions, and the expansion of government-backed insurance options like Medicaid and the health insurance marketplaces, the statement contains elements of truth. However, the phrasing ""forced into a government pool"" could be seen as alarmist and does not fully capture the complexity of the ACA's provisions and the choices available to individuals.

Considering the potential for some individuals to lose their existing health care coverage due to changes in the health care market or employer decisions, and the expansion of government-backed insurance options like Medicaid and the health insurance marketplaces, the statement contains elements of truth. However, the phrasing ""forced into a government pool"" could be seen as alarmist and does not fully capture the complexity of the ACA's provisions and the choices available to individuals.

The statement claims that Leticia Van de Putte voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony, as stated by Dan Patrick on 10/22/2014.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential biases
The statement is made by Dan Patrick, who may have a political motivation or bias, especially considering the date is close to an election period. This could imply that the statement is intended to influence public opinion.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of factual support
Without direct access to voting records or the specific context of the vote mentioned, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement directly. However, the claim suggests a specific action (voting to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony) that should be traceable through legislative records or news archives from that time.

## Step 4: Consider the implications of the statement
If true, the statement would imply that Leticia Van de Putte supported a policy that could be perceived as lenient towards teachers with felony convictions, which could be controversial. If false, it would represent a significant misrepresentation of her voting record.

## Step 5: Assess the statement based on the given criteria
Given the lack of direct evidence provided and the potential for political motivation behind the statement, it's crucial to approach this claim with skepticism. Without specific details about the vote, such as the bill number, date of the vote, or the exact nature of the felony convictions in question, it's difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Considering the potential for bias, the lack of specific details, and the importance of verifying such claims through factual evidence, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely true without further investigation. However, the claim does not seem to be entirely fabricated or implausible without more context.

The statement claims that Dan Patrick, as chair of the Senate Education Committee, led the charge to restore most of the education cuts from the last session.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on August 28, 2014. This context is crucial because it refers to actions taken during a specific legislative session.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of information
Without specific details on the legislative actions taken by Dan Patrick and the Senate Education Committee during the relevant session, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement directly.

## Step 4: Assess the claim based on typical fact-checking criteria
Given the lack of specific information to directly confirm or deny the statement, and without access to detailed records of the legislative session in question, the claim's accuracy cannot be definitively determined. However, the statement is specific enough to suggest that it could be verifiable with the right information.

## Step 5: Consider the potential for the statement to be true or false
The statement could be true if Dan Patrick indeed led efforts to restore education funding cuts during his tenure as chair of the Senate Education Committee. Conversely, it could be false if no such efforts were made or if the statement misrepresents the extent of the funding restoration.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the information provided and the context, the statement cannot be labeled as ""true"" or ""false"" without further evidence. However, since it makes a specific claim that could potentially be verified with more information, it does not seem entirely implausible or detached from reality.

The key claim is that when Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation.

## Step 2: Consider the context and source of the statement
The statement was made by David Axelrod on June 19, 2011. David Axelrod is a political strategist who was closely associated with the Obama administration, which could imply a potential bias in his statements, especially when discussing political opponents like Mitt Romney.

## Step 3: Evaluate the factual basis of the claim
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to look at the job creation rankings during Mitt Romney's governorship of Massachusetts (2003-2007). According to various sources, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Massachusetts did indeed experience slower job growth compared to other states during Romney's tenure.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the ranking
Specifically, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that during Romney's governorship, Massachusetts ranked near the bottom in terms of job creation. While the exact ranking can vary depending on the specific years considered and the source of the data, the general trend supports the notion that Massachusetts was among the lower-performing states in job creation during that period.

## Step 5: Consider any necessary clarifications or additional information
It's worth noting that job creation can be influenced by a variety of factors, including national economic trends, state-specific policies, and external events. Therefore, while Romney's policies as governor might have played a role, they were not the only factor influencing job creation in Massachusetts.

## Step 6: Conclude the assessment based on the available information
Given the data and context, the statement that Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation during Mitt Romney's governorship appears to be generally accurate, though the exact ranking might depend on the specific time frame and data source used. The statement could benefit from additional context regarding the factors influencing job creation, but it does not appear to be fundamentally misleading.

The statement claims that there are almost twice as many cops in New York City as there are on the entire U.S. border. This requires comparing the number of police officers in New York City to the number of border patrol agents or law enforcement officers on the U.S. border.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data for New York City police officers
As of 2010, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) had approximately 36,400 uniformed officers and 4,500 civilian employees, according to the NYPD's own reports and other sources from that time.

## Step 3: Determine the relevant data for U.S. border law enforcement
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for securing the borders. As of 2010, the CBP had about 20,000 agents, including both Border Patrol agents and CBP officers. This number does not include other law enforcement agencies that may have a presence on the border.

## Step 4: Compare the numbers
Comparing the approximately 36,400 NYPD officers to the about 20,000 CBP agents, it appears that the statement about having almost twice as many cops in New York City as on the entire border could be considered accurate, given the numbers from 2010.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential for missing information
The statement simplifies the comparison by focusing solely on numbers without considering the vast differences in responsibilities, jurisdictions, and the nature of the work between NYPD officers and border patrol agents. However, based on the numbers alone, the statement seems to hold up.

## Step 6: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given the information available and the context provided, the statement appears to be accurate in terms of the numerical comparison it makes. However, it lacks context regarding the different roles and areas of operation of the NYPD versus border patrol agents. Despite this, the core claim about the relative numbers seems to be supported by the data available from 2010.

The statement claims that Dan Patrick supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car, as stated by David Dewhurst on 3/2/2014.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential biases
Given that the statement comes from a political opponent (David Dewhurst) during a likely election period, there might be a bias or an attempt to misrepresent Dan Patrick's stance for political gain.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility of the claim
The claim of providing every family with a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to buy a car seems unusually broad and expensive. Typically, such vouchers or incentives are targeted towards specific groups (like low-income families or for specific purposes like education) rather than universally applied to every family.

## Step 4: Assess the lack of specific policy context
Without specific details about the proposed policy, such as its intended beneficiaries, funding sources, or the context in which Dan Patrick allegedly supported this idea, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement.

## Step 5: Consider the potential for misrepresentation
Political statements, especially from opponents, can be taken out of context, exaggerated, or distorted for political advantage. Without direct evidence or a clear policy proposal from Dan Patrick that matches this description, the statement's accuracy is questionable.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the lack of specific details, the potential for political bias, and the implausibility of the claim as stated, the most appropriate label for this statement would be ""mostly false."" This label reflects that while Dan Patrick might have discussed or supported some form of voucher system, the statement as presented likely contains significant inaccuracies or omissions that distort the truth.

## Step 2: Verify the existence and details of the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program
The ""Cash for Clunkers"" program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was a U.S. government program that was enacted in 2009 to provide financial incentives to U.S. residents who purchased a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle when trading in a less fuel-efficient vehicle.

According to records, Jack Kingston did vote in favor of the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program, which was part of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009.

The key claim in the statement is that ""Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on August 19, 2015, by Donald Trump. At that time, there was a significant trend of companies, especially in the manufacturing sector, relocating or expanding their operations to Mexico due to factors like lower labor costs and favorable trade agreements such as NAFTA.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on available data and trends
While there wasn't a specific dataset or report cited in the statement, it is known that during the early 2010s, Mexico experienced an influx of foreign investment, particularly from the United States, in sectors like automotive and aerospace. This was partly due to Mexico's strategic location, trade agreements, and competitive labor costs.

## Step 4: Determine the truthfulness of the statement
Given the context and trends at the time, it is plausible that companies were indeed moving into Mexico at a significant rate compared to other countries. However, without specific data or a comparative analysis of investment flows into different countries, it's challenging to assert the statement's absolute accuracy.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Considering the information available and the context in which the statement was made, the claim seems to have a basis in reality, reflecting a trend that was observable at the time.

The statement claims that the Steele dossier was responsible for starting Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. This investigation was a significant event in U.S. political history, focusing on potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.

## Step 2: Evaluate the role of the Steele dossier
The Steele dossier, compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, contained allegations of ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. It was one of the factors that led to the initiation of the FBI's investigation into potential collusion, which later became the basis for Mueller's special counsel investigation.

## Step 3: Consider the initiation of the Mueller investigation
The Mueller investigation was officially launched in May 2017, after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. However, the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential links to the Trump campaign began before Mueller's appointment, with the Steele dossier being one piece of information among others that contributed to the FBI's interest in the matter.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy
While the Steele dossier played a role in the FBI's initial interest in investigating potential Trump campaign ties to Russia, saying it was ""responsible for starting"" the Mueller investigation oversimplifies the complex series of events and factors that led to the investigation. The investigation was the result of cumulative evidence and concerns, not solely the dossier.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement

The claim is that Hillary Clinton promised 200,000 jobs for upstate New York when she was running for the Senate and not only did those jobs not materialize, but the area lost jobs.

## Step 2: Verify the promise
Hillary Clinton did promise to create 200,000 jobs in upstate New York during her 2000 Senate campaign.

## Step 3: Check the outcome
According to various reports and data, upstate New York did experience job losses during Clinton's time in the Senate. However, the exact number of jobs lost and the direct correlation to Clinton's promise is complex and depends on various economic factors.

## Step 4: Consider the context
The statement simplifies a complex economic situation and attributes job losses directly to Clinton's inability to fulfill her promise, without considering other factors that might have influenced the economy of upstate New York.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement
Given that Clinton did make the promise and the area did experience job losses, the statement has some basis in fact. However, it lacks context and simplifies the causes of job losses, which could be due to a variety of economic factors beyond Clinton's control or promise.

## Step 6: Determine the label

The key claim is that ""Household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on September 29, 2018, by Donald Trump. This context is important for verifying the claim as economic data can fluctuate over time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of data to support the claim
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we would need access to data on Hispanic American household income from around the time of the statement (2018) and previous years to determine if it indeed reached a record high.

## Step 4: Recall or research relevant economic data from 2018
According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, median household income for Hispanic or Latino households did increase in 2017 and potentially continued to rise in 2018, given the overall economic trends at the time.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on available information
Without the exact figures from 2018 at the time of the statement, it's challenging to definitively confirm if household income among Hispanic Americans had reached a record high. However, given the positive economic trends in 2017 and the first half of 2018, it's plausible that such a record could have been set.

## Step 6: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Donald Trump, a political figure known for making claims that are sometimes misleading or lacking in context. This requires a critical evaluation of the claim.

## Step 7: Conclude based on the evaluation
Given the potential for the statement to be true based on economic trends, but lacking specific data to confirm it as of the statement's date, and considering the source, the statement could be seen as having some basis in fact but may require additional context or clarification for full accuracy.

The statement made by Donald Trump on 10/5/2019 claims that the first so-called second-hand information whistleblower got his phone conversation almost completely wrong.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available information
Given the date and the source of the statement, it is crucial to understand the context in which this statement was made. In 2019, there were significant discussions and controversies surrounding whistleblowers and their reports, particularly in relation to President Trump's interactions, including phone calls with foreign leaders.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy
Without direct access to the specific phone conversation in question or the whistleblower's report, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of Trump's claim directly. However, considering the nature of whistleblowers' reports and the political climate at the time, it's essential to recognize that such statements are often subject to interpretation and political spin.

## Step 4: Consider the potential for bias and political motivation
Given that the statement comes from Donald Trump, who has been known to dispute and criticize reports and investigations into his actions, there is a potential for bias and political motivation behind the statement. This could influence the accuracy and the intent behind the claim.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the lack of concrete evidence to support or refute the statement directly, and considering the context and potential for political motivation, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without more information.

The statement claims ""Long gas lines forming in North Korea."" To assess its accuracy, we need to consider the context and available information as of the date it was made, September 17, 2017.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available information as of the statement date
As of 2017, North Korea was facing significant economic challenges and international sanctions, which could potentially lead to shortages of essential goods, including gasoline. However, without specific reports or data from that time, it's difficult to confirm the existence of ""long gas lines"" solely based on the statement.

## Step 3: Assess the reliability of the source
The statement is attributed to Donald Trump. While he was the President of the United States at the time and had access to intelligence reports, his public statements have sometimes been controversial or not entirely accurate. Therefore, it's essential to consider the potential for bias or inaccuracy.

## Step 4: Determine the label based on the evaluation

The statement made by Donald Trump on 1/19/2019 is: ""One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north."" This statement implies a specific statistic regarding the rate of sexual assault against women during their journey north, presumably referring to migration towards the United States.

## Step 2: Evaluate the context and available data
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider available data and reports from around the time the statement was made. Various organizations, including human rights groups and governmental agencies, have studied and reported on the conditions faced by migrants, including the risk of sexual assault.

## Step 3: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Donald Trump, who has made numerous claims about immigration and border security. The accuracy of his statements has varied, and some have been controversial or not supported by evidence.

## Step 4: Look for factual support or contradiction
There have been reports and studies indicating that women and girls are at a high risk of sexual violence during migration. For example, a 2017 report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) noted that sexual and gender-based violence is a significant protection concern for refugees and migrants. However, the specific statistic of ""one in three"" needs to be verified against credible sources.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statistic
Without a specific, credible source to back up the ""one in three"" statistic, it's challenging to label the statement as entirely true. While it's acknowledged that sexual assault is a significant risk for women during migration, the precise rate can vary depending on the source, the specific migration route, and the time frame considered.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Given the lack of a specific, credible source to support the ""one in three"" statistic and considering the general knowledge that women face a high risk of sexual assault during migration, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely accurate without further clarification or evidence.

The statement claims that the Secure Communities Program and 287(g) immigration programs were effective but were ""recklessly gutted"" by the Obama administration.

## Step 2: Background on Secure Communities Program
The Secure Communities Program was launched in 2008 to identify and deport undocumented immigrants who had committed serious crimes. It allowed local law enforcement to share fingerprints with federal immigration authorities.

## Step 3: Background on 287(g) Program
The 287(g) program, established in 1996, allows local law enforcement agencies to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enforce federal immigration laws.

## Step 4: Changes Under the Obama Administration
The Obama administration did make changes to these programs. In 2014, the Secure Communities Program was replaced by the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which focused on deporting individuals who posed a threat to national security, public safety, and border security. The 287(g) program was also modified, with the Obama administration limiting its scope and emphasizing the deportation of serious criminals.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement
While the Obama administration did modify and limit the scope of these programs, labeling them as ""recklessly gutted"" could be seen as subjective and misleading. The changes aimed to prioritize the deportation of serious offenders and improve the programs' focus on public safety.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the modifications made by the Obama administration to focus on public safety and serious offenders, the statement that these programs ""were programs that worked"" but were ""recklessly gutted"" is partially accurate but omits important details about the reasons for the changes and the continued operation of the programs in a modified form.

The statement claims that in New York state, white people have to go to the back of the line to get medical help, implying a racial preference in medical treatment.

As of the given date (1/15/2022), there were discussions and implementations of policies aimed at addressing health disparities, including those based on racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, these policies generally focus on prioritizing individuals based on medical need, not race.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy
The claim that white people are sent to the back of the line for medical help in New York state is not supported by factual evidence. Medical treatment prioritization is typically based on the severity of the condition, the urgency of the need, and other medical factors, not race.

## Step 4: Consider the source of the statement

The statement claims that the Obama administration gave Iran ""$400 million in ransom payment cash."" This implies a direct payment of cash in exchange for something, which in the context of international relations, could imply a ransom for hostages or other concessions.

## Step 2: Consider the context and known facts
In January 2016, it was announced that the United States and Iran had reached a settlement regarding a dispute over arms sales that dated back to before the 1979 Iranian Revolution. As part of this settlement, the U.S. agreed to pay Iran $1.7 billion, which included $400 million in cash. This payment was made in connection with the release of American prisoners held in Iran, but the Obama administration maintained that the payment was not a ransom.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
The statement that the Obama administration gave Iran ""$400 million in ransom payment cash"" is partially accurate in that $400 million in cash was indeed paid to Iran. However, labeling this as a ""ransom payment"" is misleading because the Obama administration and other experts argued that the payment was part of a larger settlement and not directly a ransom for the prisoners. The timing of the payment and the release of prisoners coincided, but the administration's position was that the payment was for a legitimate claim and not a quid pro quo for the prisoners' release.

## Step 4: Determine the appropriate label
Given that the statement contains an element of truth (the $400 million payment) but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression (the payment's context as part of a settlement and not a direct ransom), the statement should be labeled as ""mostly false."" This is because while it is based on a real event, the characterization of the payment as ""ransom"" is disputed and the statement lacks the necessary context to be considered accurate.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"Says ""Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvaniastreets, to prey all over this country.""",10/10/2018,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/oct/31/donald-trump/donald-trumps-wild-number-sanctuary-city-criminal-/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the key components of the statement
The statement claims that Bob Casey voted in favor of ""deadly sanctuary cities"" that released ""thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members"" to prey on Pennsylvania streets and the rest of the country.

## Step 2: Determine the accuracy of the claim about Bob Casey's vote
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to verify if Bob Casey indeed voted in favor of policies supporting sanctuary cities. Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, which can include not inquiring about the immigration status of individuals or not detaining them solely based on their immigration status.

## Step 3: Consider the context of sanctuary cities and their impact
Sanctuary cities do not necessarily ""release"" criminals to prey on streets. Instead, they often have policies in place to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation for minor offenses, while still cooperating with federal authorities on serious crimes. The statement's portrayal of sanctuary cities as directly causing the release of ""thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members"" is a simplification and misrepresentation of the complex issues surrounding immigration and crime.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's claim about the release of criminals
There is no evidence to support the claim that Bob Casey's votes directly led to the release of thousands of illegal alien criminals and gang members. While it is true that some sanctuary cities have been criticized for not fully cooperating with federal immigration authorities, which can lead to the release of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, the statement exaggerates and distorts the relationship between sanctuary city policies and the release of dangerous criminals.

## Step 5: Assess the overall truthfulness of the statement
Given the exaggeration, distortion, and lack of evidence supporting the claim that Bob Casey's votes led to the release of thousands of dangerous criminals, the statement is not accurate. It ignores critical facts about how sanctuary cities operate and the complexities of immigration policy, instead relying on inflammatory rhetoric.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"The stories from women saying he groped or forced himself on them ""largely have been debunked.""",10/19/2016,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-reports-sexual-assault-him-have-/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the statement and its context
The statement made by Donald Trump on 10/19/2016 claims that the stories from women saying he groped or forced himself on them ""largely have been debunked.""

## Step 2: Evaluate the truthfulness of the statement
To assess the truthfulness, we need to consider the context and available information. The statement was made during a time when several women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump. The term ""largely have been debunked"" implies that the majority of these allegations have been proven false.

## Step 3: Consider the source and potential biases
The statement comes directly from Donald Trump, who is the subject of the allegations. This could introduce a bias, as individuals often defend themselves against accusations.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of evidence and fact-checking
At the time of the statement and even afterward, numerous fact-checking organizations and media outlets investigated these allegations. While some allegations may have been disputed or lacked concrete evidence, others were corroborated by witnesses or had significant credibility.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the evaluation
Given the context, the source, and the complexity of verifying each allegation, the statement that the stories ""largely have been debunked"" does not accurately reflect the situation. Many allegations were not debunked and remained credible, making the statement misleading.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"""They never thought ... that I was going to release that call and I really had no choice because Adam Schiff made up a call.""",11/15/2019,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/nov/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-schiff-ukraine-timeline-phone-memo/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement made by Donald Trump on 11/15/2019 claims that he had no choice but to release a call because Adam Schiff made up a call. This implies that Trump's action was a response to Schiff's alleged fabrication.

## Step 2: Consider the context and facts surrounding the statement
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the events and facts surrounding the release of the call and Adam Schiff's actions. The call in question is likely related to the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, which was ongoing at the time of the statement.

## Step 3: Evaluate Adam Schiff's role and actions
Adam Schiff, as the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, played a key role in the impeachment inquiry. He did paraphrase the content of a call between President Trump and the Ukrainian President during a hearing, which some critics argued was misleading or inaccurate.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of Trump's claim
Given that Adam Schiff did paraphrase the call and that Trump released the transcript of the call afterward, we can assess whether Trump's claim that he ""had no choice"" but to release the call because Schiff ""made up"" a call is accurate.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Considering the facts, Trump's statement that he released the call because Adam Schiff made up a call can be seen as partially true but also misleading. Schiff did paraphrase the call in a way that was criticized, but saying he ""made up"" a call might be an exaggeration. Trump's decision to release the call could be seen as a response to Schiff's actions, but the characterization of Schiff's actions as ""making up"" a call is not entirely accurate.

The statement claims that as of the given date (7/11/2015), if you are from Syria and a Christian, you cannot come into the United States as a refugee, according to Donald Trump.

## Step 2: Consider the context and policies at the time
In 2015, the Syrian Civil War was ongoing, and there was a significant refugee crisis. The U.S. had policies in place for accepting refugees, but these policies did not explicitly bar Christians from Syria. However, the process for refugee admission is complex and involves multiple steps, including screening and background checks.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for accuracy
The statement suggests a blanket policy that specifically excludes Syrian Christians from entering the U.S. as refugees. However, U.S. refugee policy does not categorically deny entry based on religion. The process is supposed to be based on individual circumstances, including persecution, fear of persecution, or other humanitarian grounds.

## Step 4: Consider Trump's stance and public statements
Donald Trump, during his presidential campaign, made several statements about immigration and refugees, including those from Syria. He expressed concerns about security and the potential for terrorists to infiltrate the refugee program. However, stating that Christians from Syria ""cannot come into this country"" as refugees simplifies a complex issue and does not accurately reflect the nuanced policies in place.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Given the information and the context, the statement is misleading because it implies a specific policy that categorically denies entry to Syrian Christian refugees, which was not the case. The U.S. refugee admission process is more complex, and while there may have been difficulties or biases in the system, a blanket statement like this does not accurately represent the policy or process.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"Says Joe Biden ""is even talking about taking the wall down.""",8/27/2020,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/28/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-rnc-claim-about-joe-biden-and-/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Identify the statement and its components
The statement made by Donald Trump on 8/27/2020 is: ""Says Joe Biden 'is even talking about taking the wall down.'"" This statement implies that Joe Biden has expressed interest or intent in dismantling the wall, presumably referring to the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available information
As of the statement's date (8/27/2020), Joe Biden's stance on the border wall was to stop construction and not build any more of it, rather than specifically focusing on tearing down existing sections. However, the exact details of his policy could evolve, and it's possible he might have discussed or considered removing parts of the wall, especially if they were deemed unnecessary or harmful.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for accuracy and context
Given the information available up to 8/27/2020, while Joe Biden did express opposition to the border wall and the continuation of its construction, there wasn't widespread evidence that he explicitly stated he would ""take the wall down."" His focus was more on halting further construction and addressing immigration through other means.

## Step 4: Determine the label based on the evaluation
Considering the statement might have some basis in Biden's opposition to the wall but lacks specific evidence that he planned to dismantle it, the statement seems to take his position out of context or exaggerate it. Therefore, it doesn't fully align with the facts as they were known at the time.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"Says ""the New York Times wrote about"" Barack Obama wiretapping Donald Trump during the election.",3/15/2017,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/mar/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-learned-obama-tapped-his-phon/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that ""the New York Times wrote about"" Barack Obama wiretapping Donald Trump during the election. This implies that there should be evidence of such an article in the New York Times.

## Step 2: Consider the context and the source of the statement
The statement was made by Donald Trump on March 15, 2017. Given the source and the context of political tensions and allegations of surveillance, it's crucial to verify if the New York Times indeed published an article supporting Trump's claim.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility based on known facts
It is known that Donald Trump accused Barack Obama of wiretapping him in a series of tweets in March 2017. However, there was no credible evidence to support the claim that Obama ordered a wiretap on Trump. The New York Times did report on the allegations and the subsequent investigations, but there's a distinction between reporting on allegations and confirming them as fact.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given that the New York Times would have reported on significant political allegations, the key question is whether they reported on Obama ordering a wiretap on Trump as a fact. If the Times only reported on Trump's allegations without confirming the wiretapping as a fact, then the statement could be misleading.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on the evaluation
The statement seems to imply that the New York Times confirmed or reported on the wiretapping as a fact, which would be misleading. The Times did cover the story, but the coverage would have been about the allegations made by Trump rather than confirming the wiretapping occurred. This distinction is crucial for determining the statement's accuracy.

pants-fire,Donald Trump,"Says as president he has ""total"" authority to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",4/13/2020,other,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/14/donald-trump/trumps-ridiculous-statement-about-total-authority-/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that as president, Donald Trump has ""total"" authority to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This statement was made on April 13, 2020.

## Step 2: Evaluating the Context
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authority to re-open states involves considerations of public health, economic impact, and legal jurisdiction. The U.S. Constitution and federal laws outline the powers of the president and the relationship between the federal government and the states.

## Step 3: Assessing Presidential Authority
The president has significant authority under federal law, especially in times of national emergency, as declared under the National Emergencies Act. However, the Constitution also grants states considerable autonomy, particularly in matters of public health and safety.

## Step 4: Considering Legal and Constitutional Limits
While the president can issue guidelines and recommendations, the actual authority to open or close businesses, schools, and other public places typically rests with state and local governments. The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves to the states those powers not delegated to the federal government, which includes many aspects of public health policy.

## Step 5: Evaluating the Statement for Accuracy
Given the legal and constitutional framework, the claim of having ""total"" authority to re-open states is an overstatement. The president can influence decisions through federal funding, guidelines, and emergency declarations but does not have absolute authority to override state decisions on reopening.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement that as president, Donald Trump has ""total"" authority to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic is not accurate. It ignores the significant role of state governments in public health matters and the constitutional limits on federal power.

mostly-true,Donald Trump,"The Jerusalem Embassy Act ""passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.""",12/06/2017,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/dec/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-about-history-jerusalem-embas/,TRUE,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that the Jerusalem Embassy Act passed Congress with an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate six months prior to December 6, 2017.

## Step 2: Verify the passage of the Jerusalem Embassy Act
The Jerusalem Embassy Act was indeed passed by Congress in 1995, which supports the first part of the statement regarding its passage.

## Step 3: Check for reaffirmation by the Senate
To verify the second part of the statement, we need to check if the Senate reaffirmed the Jerusalem Embassy Act by a unanimous vote six months before December 6, 2017. This would mean the reaffirmation occurred around June 2017.

## Step 4: Research Senate actions around June 2017
In June 2017, the Senate did vote on a resolution related to the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which was indeed unanimous, supporting the move of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.

## Step 5: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given that the Jerusalem Embassy Act was passed with bipartisan support in 1995 and considering the Senate's unanimous vote in June 2017 on a related resolution, the statement appears to be accurate. However, it's crucial to ensure no significant details are omitted that could alter the interpretation of the statement's accuracy.

## Step 6: Consider the context and potential omissions
The statement's context is about the legislative support for the Jerusalem Embassy Act and its reaffirmation. The key information provided is accurate, but the statement simplifies the legislative history and the process of reaffirmation. Nonetheless, the core claim about bipartisan passage and a recent unanimous Senate vote is correct.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"""In seven years that (nuclear) deal will have expired, and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons.""",4/30/2018,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-wrongly-iran-nuclear-deal-expire/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Understand the statement
The statement claims that in seven years, the nuclear deal with Iran will have expired, and Iran will be free to create nuclear weapons.

## Step 2: Recall the details of the nuclear deal with Iran
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was signed in 2015. It imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

## Step 3: Determine the duration of the deal's restrictions
Key restrictions in the deal, such as limits on the number of centrifuges and the level of uranium enrichment, were set to expire after 10 to 15 years, not seven. However, some provisions, like the ban on Iran's development of nuclear weapons, are permanent under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to which Iran is a signatory.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given that the deal's major restrictions expire between 10 to 15 years after its implementation (which started in 2016), saying the deal will have expired in seven years (from 2018) and Iran will be ""free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons"" is misleading. Iran is already prohibited from developing nuclear weapons by the NPT, and the JCPOA's expiration does not directly grant permission for such development.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential for confusion
The statement might cause confusion by implying that the expiration of certain restrictions automatically allows Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, which is not the case due to the NPT and other international agreements.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given the inaccuracies and the potential for confusion, the statement should be labeled as ""mostly false"" because it contains an element of truth (some restrictions do expire) but ignores critical facts (permanent bans on nuclear weapons development and the timeline of the deal's restrictions).

The statement made by Donald Trump on January 14, 2017, describes Georgia's 5th congressional district, represented by John Lewis, as being ""in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested)."" The key components to fact-check are the condition of the district and the level of crime.

## Step 2: Evaluate the condition of Georgia's 5th congressional district
Georgia's 5th congressional district includes parts of Atlanta and surrounding areas. As of 2017, the district was known for its economic and cultural vibrancy, including the presence of several major universities, the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. While like many urban areas, it faced challenges such as poverty and crime in certain neighborhoods, describing the entire district as ""in horrible shape and falling apart"" does not accurately reflect its overall condition.

## Step 3: Assess the crime situation in the district
Crime rates can vary significantly within different parts of a congressional district. While some areas within the 5th district of Georgia may have higher crime rates, labeling the entire district as ""crime infested"" is misleading. According to FBI crime data, the overall crime rate in Atlanta (which is the core of the 5th district) has fluctuated over the years but does not support the blanket statement made by Trump.

## Step 4: Consider the context and timing of the statement
The statement was made by Donald Trump on January 14, 2017, which is relevant because it was part of a series of tweets criticizing John Lewis, a civil rights icon and congressman, after Lewis announced he would not attend Trump's inauguration. The context suggests the statement might be more politically motivated than factually driven.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information about the district's condition and crime rates, and considering the context in which the statement was made, it appears that the description of Georgia's 5th congressional district as ""in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested)"" is not supported by factual evidence. The statement ignores the district's positive aspects and exaggerates its challenges.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"""Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party.

The statement claims that Donald Trump has the highest poll numbers in the history of the Republican Party, including those of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. To assess this, we need to consider the availability and reliability of historical poll data, especially for figures like Abraham Lincoln, who lived in the 19th century when polling as we know it today did not exist.

## Step 2: Consider the availability of historical poll data.
For Abraham Lincoln, who was president from 1861 until his assassination in 1865, modern polling did not exist. Thus, comparing Trump's poll numbers directly to Lincoln's is not feasible based on the lack of historical data for Lincoln.

## Step 3: Assess the comparison with Ronald Reagan.
While Ronald Reagan's presidency (1981-1989) did occur during a time when polling was more sophisticated, the statement's claim about Trump having higher poll numbers than Reagan requires specific data for comparison. However, it's known that Reagan enjoyed high approval ratings during his presidency, especially after his recovery from the assassination attempt and during periods of economic growth.

## Step 4: Consider the context of the statement.
The statement was made by Donald Trump on July 29, 2018. At that time, Trump's approval ratings were a subject of much discussion, with various polls showing a range of approval percentages. The claim of having the ""highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party"" would need to be verified against historical data and the specific polls Trump is referencing.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement based on the analysis.
Given the lack of direct comparability with Lincoln due to the absence of historical polling data, and considering the need for specific, verifiable data to compare with Reagan's or any other Republican president's poll numbers, the statement appears to be an exaggeration or not supported by factual evidence that can be verified across historical contexts.

FALSE,Donald Trump,"""Our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID.  So what they do is they say, I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.""",10/30/2020,campaign,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/01/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-doctors-inflate-covid-19/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the key claim in the statement
The key claim in the statement made by Donald Trump is that doctors get more money if a patient dies from COVID-19, and as a result, they classify every death as being due to COVID-19.

## Step 2: Evaluate the claim based on known facts and medical practices
In the medical field, the classification of cause of death is based on clinical judgment and diagnostic criteria, not on financial incentives. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) provide guidelines for reporting and coding causes of death, including those related to COVID-19. These guidelines are designed to ensure accuracy and consistency in reporting, regardless of financial considerations.

## Step 3: Consider the financial aspect of healthcare and potential incentives
While it is true that healthcare providers can receive different levels of reimbursement based on the diagnosis and treatment of patients, the idea that doctors are incentivized to misclassify deaths as COVID-19 for financial gain oversimplifies the complex reimbursement systems in place. These systems vary by country, region, and even by specific healthcare plans, and they are subject to numerous regulations and audits to prevent fraud.

## Step 4: Assess the statement in the context of the date and source
Given the date of the statement (October 30, 2020) and the source (Donald Trump), it is essential to consider the political and social context. During this period, there were ongoing debates and misinformation about COVID-19, its severity, and the responses to the pandemic. Statements from public figures were often scrutinized for accuracy and potential political motivations.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Based on the evaluation of medical practices, financial incentives in healthcare, and the context in which the statement was made, the claim that doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID-19 and therefore classify every death as COVID-19 is not supported by factual evidence. The process of determining cause of death is rigorous and guided by medical standards, not financial gain.

The statement claims that when American businesses sell products in China, they have to pay a tremendous tax, but when China sells products to the United States, there is no tax.

## Step 2: Identifying the key components
The key components of the statement are the existence of a ""tremendous tax"" on American businesses selling in China and the absence of any tax on Chinese businesses selling to the United States.

## Step 3: Evaluating the tax situation
In international trade, countries often impose tariffs (taxes on imported goods) and other trade barriers. However, the statement simplifies the tax situation to a binary ""tremendous tax"" on one side and ""no tax"" on the other, which does not accurately reflect the complexities of international trade agreements and tariffs.

## Step 4: Considering trade agreements and tariffs
As of the statement's date (3/26/2016), the United States and China had various trade agreements and tariffs in place. The U.S. imposed tariffs on certain Chinese goods, and China did the same on U.S. goods. The notion that there is ""no tax"" when China sells to the U.S. is misleading, as both countries had tariffs and other trade barriers.

## Step 5: Assessing the statement's accuracy
Given the simplification and the lack of acknowledgment of the complexities of international trade, including the existence of tariffs on both sides, the statement is not entirely accurate. It omits critical facts that would give a different impression of the trade relationship between the U.S. and China.

## Step 6: Labeling the statement
Considering the statement's simplification and omission of critical facts, it cannot be labeled as ""true"" or ""mostly true."" It contains an element of truth in that tariffs exist, but it ignores the fact that both countries impose tariffs, making the statement misleading.

The statement claims that ""Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan."" This implies a complete relocation of Chrysler's operations from Mexico to Michigan.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential implications
Given the date of the statement (1/16/2018) and the source (Donald Trump), it's essential to consider the context of trade policies and announcements around that time. The statement could be related to changes in trade policies or corporate decisions influenced by political announcements.

## Step 3: Evaluate the factual accuracy of the statement
As of the statement's date, there were discussions and announcements about companies reconsidering their operations in Mexico due to potential changes in trade policies, such as the renegotiation of NAFTA. However, the statement's absolute nature (""leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan"") requires verification of whether Chrysler indeed made such a move.

## Step 4: Research the outcome of Chrysler's operations
After the statement was made, it's crucial to verify if Chrysler did indeed leave Mexico and move its operations back to Michigan. This involves checking for any official announcements from Chrysler or its parent company, FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), regarding the relocation of their manufacturing facilities.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Without specific details on Chrysler's actions following the statement, the claim's accuracy depends on whether there was a significant relocation of Chrysler's operations from Mexico to Michigan. If such a move occurred, the statement could be considered true. However, if the move was partial, not entirely from Mexico to Michigan, or did not happen as stated, the claim would be less accurate.

## Step 6: Consider the complexity of corporate relocation decisions
Corporate decisions to relocate operations are complex and can involve partial moves, expansions, or contractions in different locations without a complete abandonment of one country for another. The statement's simplicity might not reflect the complexity of such decisions.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Given the potential for partial truths or the complexity of corporate decisions, and without specific evidence of a complete relocation of Chrysler's operations from Mexico to Michigan as of the statement's date, the claim might not be entirely accurate. However, the exact label (true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, implausible) depends on the specifics of Chrysler's actions, which are not detailed in the provided information.

The statement claims that when asked about court-packing, Biden's staff immediately escorts the camera out. This implies a specific action taken by Biden's staff in response to a particular question.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement (10/26/2020) and the source (Donald Trump), it's essential to understand the context. During this period, the topic of court-packing was a significant issue in the U.S. political landscape, especially with the upcoming presidential election and the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

## Step 3: Evaluate the credibility of the source
The source of the statement is Donald Trump, who was the President of the United States at the time and a political opponent of Joe Biden. This context suggests that the statement could be politically motivated and might not be entirely objective.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of evidence
Without specific evidence or a direct video recording of the incident where Biden's staff escorted a camera out when asked about court-packing, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, it's known that during the 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden did avoid directly answering questions about court-packing, which could have led to situations where his staff might intervene to change the subject or end an interview.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of direct evidence to confirm the specific incident described and considering the political context and potential bias of the source, the statement cannot be labeled as entirely true without further clarification or evidence. However, it's also known that Biden was evasive on the topic of court-packing, which might have led to staff intervention in some instances.

The key claim is that Hillary Clinton once ""wanted a wall"" on the Mexican border.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available information
As of the statement's date (8/5/2016), we need to consider what was known about Hillary Clinton's stance on border security and immigration.

## Step 3: Recall Hillary Clinton's past statements and policies on border security
In 2006, Hillary Clinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act, which aimed to construct physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. However, her stance evolved over time, and by the 2016 presidential campaign, she emphasized comprehensive immigration reform and did not advocate for a wall across the entire border.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on the available information
Given that Hillary Clinton did support some form of physical barrier in the past (as part of a broader approach to border security), but later focused on more comprehensive solutions, the statement simplifies her position and takes it out of context.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the evolution of Clinton's stance and the simplification of her position in the statement, the claim is partially accurate but omits important details and context.

The statement was made by Donald Trump on November 4, 2020, regarding the outcome of an election, which is likely the U.S. presidential election.

## Step 2: Recall the events surrounding the election on the given date
On November 4, 2020, the U.S. presidential election was still in the process of being counted, with several key states not having declared their results. The outcome of the election was not yet officially determined.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement against the known facts at the time
Given that the election results were not finalized and several states had not completed their vote counts, declaring ""We already have won"" the election would be premature and not supported by the facts at the time.

## Step 4: Consider the source and potential biases
The statement comes from Donald Trump, a candidate in the election, which may introduce bias towards claiming victory to influence public perception or to preempt the official outcome.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on the criteria
Given the lack of official confirmation of the election results at the time of the statement and considering the context, the statement does not align with the facts as they were known on November 4, 2020. It ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, specifically the ongoing vote counting and the lack of official declarations from key states.

The statement claims that Goodyear Tires announced a ban on MAGA hats, which is attributed to the actions of the ""Radical Left Democrats.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and source of the statement
The statement was made by Donald Trump on August 19, 2020. Given the political context, it's essential to verify the claim through reputable sources to assess its accuracy.

## Step 3: Verify the claim about Goodyear Tires
On August 19, 2020, it was reported that Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company faced backlash after a slide from a diversity training presentation was leaked, showing that the company considered ""MAGA"" attire unacceptable, while allowing other forms of political expression like Black Lives Matter or LGBTQ+ support. However, the company later clarified that the slide was not part of their official policy and that they did not ban MAGA hats.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the clarification from Goodyear Tires, the statement that they ""announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS"" is misleading. The company did not officially announce such a ban, and the leaked slide was part of an internal discussion, not a policy.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the information and the clarification provided by Goodyear Tires, the statement contains an element of truth (the leaked slide) but ignores critical facts (the company's clarification that it was not an official policy and they did not ban MAGA hats). This means the statement gives a misleading impression of the company's actions.

The statement claims that John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA, as stated by Donald Trump on July 7, 2017.

## Step 2: Determine the facts surrounding the statement
It is known that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was hacked in 2016, and the FBI did investigate this incident. However, the DNC did not directly give the FBI the server for analysis. Instead, the DNC hired a private cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, to investigate and remediate the hack. The FBI was provided with the findings and evidence collected by CrowdStrike.

## Step 3: Evaluate the involvement of John Podesta
John Podesta was the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and was a target of a separate phishing attack, which led to the release of his emails. While Podesta's emails were hacked, the statement specifically mentions the DNC server, which is a different issue.

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the statement
The statement simplifies the situation and implies that John Podesta personally refused to give the server to the FBI and the CIA, which is not entirely accurate. The decision not to provide the server directly to the FBI was made by the DNC, and the investigation was handled through the evidence provided by CrowdStrike.

## Step 5: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement (July 7, 2017), it is clear that the context is the ongoing discussion and investigation into the 2016 presidential election hacking incidents. However, the statement does not accurately reflect the nuances of the situation regarding the DNC server and the investigations.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the criteria
Given the information and the analysis, the statement contains an element of truth (the DNC did not give the server directly to the FBI) but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression (the DNC worked with a cybersecurity firm and provided the FBI with the findings, and John Podesta's role is misrepresented in the context of the server).

The statement was made by Donald Trump on July 16, 2017, regarding his job approval poll numbers in comparison to other presidents at the same point in their presidencies.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant data for comparison
To assess the accuracy of Trump's statement, we need to look at his job approval ratings at the time of the statement and compare them with those of other presidents at similar stages in their terms.

## Step 3: Recall historical job approval ratings for presidents
Historically, job approval ratings for presidents can vary widely. For instance, presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy had high approval ratings, while others like Richard Nixon and George W. Bush had lower ratings at certain points in their presidencies.

## Step 4: Consider Trump's job approval ratings in 2017
As of July 2017, Trump's job approval ratings were lower than many of his predecessors at the same point in their presidencies. According to Gallup polls, Trump's average approval rating for his first six months was around 41%, which was lower than most previous presidents.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the available data
Given the lower job approval ratings of Trump compared to many other presidents at similar stages, the statement that his numbers are ""not bad"" relative to others could be seen as misleading or inaccurate without proper context. It might be an attempt to downplay the significance of his lower ratings.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement seems to ignore critical facts that would give a different impression about Trump's job approval ratings compared to other presidents. Thus, it does not align with being true, mostly true, or half true, as it lacks significant context or comparison that would make the claim accurate.

The statement claims that African-American communities are in the worst shape they have ever been in before, as of the date it was made (9/20/2016) by Donald Trump.

## Step 2: Consider historical context
Historically, African-American communities have faced significant challenges, including slavery, segregation, and systemic racism. The statement's claim that their condition is the ""worst ever"" needs to be evaluated against this backdrop.

## Step 3: Evaluate economic indicators
As of 2016, while there were certainly challenges, many economic indicators such as unemployment rates and access to education had improved for African-Americans compared to historical lows.

## Step 4: Consider social and political advancements
The period leading up to 2016 saw significant social and political advancements for African-Americans, including the election of the first African-American president, Barack Obama, and ongoing efforts to address racial disparities in the justice system and other areas.

## Step 5: Assess the statement's accuracy
Given the historical context and the advancements in various areas, the blanket statement that African-American communities were in the ""worst shape they've ever been in before"" as of 2016 does not accurately reflect the complexity of the situation. It overlooks improvements in certain areas and the progress made towards equality and justice.

## Step 6: Determine the label
The statement is not entirely accurate and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It does not account for the nuanced view of progress and challenges faced by African-American communities. Therefore, it should be labeled as ""mostly false"" because it contains an element of truth (that challenges exist) but ignores critical facts that would provide a more balanced view.

The statement is ""Hillary Clinton says she wants to raise taxes on the middle class"" and it was made by Donald Trump on 8/4/2016.

## Step 2: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy
To determine the accuracy of the statement, we need to consider Hillary Clinton's tax proposals during her 2016 presidential campaign. Clinton proposed raising taxes on the wealthy, not the middle class. Her plans included increasing taxes on high-income earners and closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy.

## Step 3: Consider the context and potential for misleading information
Given that the statement was made by Donald Trump, a political opponent of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, there's a potential for the statement to be misleading or taken out of context to sway public opinion.

## Step 4: Determine the label based on the evaluation
Since Hillary Clinton's proposals were focused on increasing taxes on the wealthy and not the middle class, the statement made by Donald Trump is not accurate. It does not reflect Clinton's actual tax plans and is misleading.

The key claim is that ""The murder rate in our country is the highest its been in 47 years.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on February 7, 2017, by Donald Trump. This context is crucial for verifying the claim as it refers to a specific time frame.

## Step 3: Recall or research the murder rate trends in the United States around 2017
According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which collects and analyzes crime data from law enforcement agencies across the United States, the murder rate had been declining over the past few decades but can fluctuate from year to year.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on available data
As of 2017, the murder rate in the United States had indeed seen fluctuations, but it was not at its highest in 47 years. The highest murder rate in the U.S. was recorded in the early 1990s. The murder rate had decreased significantly from its peak in 1991.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on its accuracy
Given the information from the FBI's UCR and considering the trends in murder rates, the statement that ""The murder rate in our country is the highest its been in 47 years"" as of 2017 is not accurate. The murder rate had been higher in the past, specifically in the early 1990s, and thus the claim made by Donald Trump does not align with factual data.

The key claim in the statement is that poor forest management is the sole reason for the massive, deadly, and costly forest fires in California.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on November 10, 2018, during a period when California was indeed experiencing severe forest fires. This context is crucial for understanding the potential factors contributing to these fires.

## Step 3: Evaluate the role of forest management in forest fires
Forest management is one factor that can influence the risk and severity of forest fires. Proper management can include practices like thinning, prescribed burns, and creating fire breaks, which can help reduce the risk of large, uncontrolled fires. However, it is not the only factor; weather conditions, climate change, human activity (such as arson or accidental ignition), and topography also play significant roles.

## Step 4: Consider the complexity of factors contributing to forest fires
The statement simplifies the cause of forest fires to a single factor (poor forest management), ignoring the complexity and multifaceted nature of the issue. Climate change, for example, has been linked to an increase in extreme weather conditions, such as drought and high temperatures, which can significantly contribute to the risk and severity of forest fires.

## Step 5: Assess the statement based on the criteria provided
Given the simplification and the omission of critical factors that contribute to forest fires, the statement does not accurately reflect the complexity of the issue. While forest management is an important factor, it is not the only reason for the occurrence of massive, deadly, and costly forest fires in California.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement is partially accurate in highlighting the importance of forest management but is misleading because it ignores other critical factors such as climate change, weather conditions, and human activity. Therefore, the statement should be labeled as ""mostly false"" because it contains an element of truth (the importance of forest management) but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the real GDP growth rate for 2016 was indeed 1.6%. This confirms the GDP growth rate mentioned in the statement.

## Step 3: Determine if it was the slowest economic growth in five years
To verify if 2016 had the slowest economic growth in five years, we need to look at the GDP growth rates for the preceding years (2012-2015). The real GDP growth rates for those years were: 2012 (2.2%), 2013 (1.7%), 2014 (2.4%), and 2015 (2.1%). The year 2016, with a 1.6% growth rate, was indeed one of the slower years, but we need to compare it directly with the year immediately before, 2015, and the year before that, 2013, to see if it was the slowest. Since 2013 had a growth rate of 1.7%, 2016 was not the slowest in the five-year period but was among the slower years.

## Step 4: Assess the impact of trade deficits on the economy
The statement claims that trade deficits hurt the economy very badly. While trade deficits can have negative effects on the economy, such as reducing domestic employment in certain sectors, the overall impact of trade deficits on the economy is complex and can vary. The statement simplifies this complex issue.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on the criteria

However, the claim that 2016 was the slowest economic growth in five years is not entirely accurate since 2013 had a slightly higher growth rate but still lower than other years, making 2016 among the slower but not the slowest.

The statement claims that President Dwight Eisenhower moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of the country.

## Step 2: Research the historical context and facts
President Dwight Eisenhower did indeed oversee a significant operation related to immigration. Operation Wetback, which took place in 1954, was aimed at deporting undocumented immigrants, primarily of Mexican descent, from the United States.

## Step 3: Verify the numbers and details of the operation
According to historical records, Operation Wetback resulted in the deportation of approximately 1.1 million people, not 1.5 million as stated. However, the operation was indeed large-scale and targeted undocumented immigrants.

The statement claims that Joe Biden said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, but then a picture emerged showing him playing golf with the company boss and Hunter Biden.

## Step 2: Determine the accuracy of the claim about Joe Biden's statement
There is no evidence to suggest that Joe Biden ever said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company. This claim appears to be unfounded.

## Step 3: Assess the existence and implications of the picture
While there are photos of Joe Biden and his son Hunter with various individuals, the specific context of a picture showing Joe Biden playing golf with a Ukrainian company boss and Hunter Biden, as implied to contradict Joe Biden's statements, needs verification. However, the existence of such a picture does not necessarily contradict Joe Biden's statements about his official interactions or the nature of his conversations.

The statement claims that 122 prisoners released from Guantanamo Bay (Gitmo) by the Obama Administration have returned to the battlefield.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
As of the statement's date (3/7/2017), we need to verify if there were reports or official data confirming the number of prisoners released by the Obama Administration who returned to terrorist activities.

## Step 3: Evaluate the source of the statement
The statement is from Donald Trump, who was the President of the United States at the time. His statements, especially on controversial topics like terrorism and national security, are subject to scrutiny and fact-checking.

## Step 4: Recall relevant reports and data from that time
According to reports and official data available up to 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) periodically released information on the number of Guantanamo detainees who were confirmed or suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after their release.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
As of 2017, the ODNI reported that out of 728 detainees released from Guantanamo, 122 were confirmed to have reengaged in terrorist activities, and another 86 were suspected of reengaging. However, these numbers spanned releases from both the Bush and Obama administrations.

## Step 6: Assess the statement for truthfulness based on the criteria
Given that the statement specifies ""released by the Obama Administration"" and claims ""122 vicious prisoners... have returned to the battlefield,"" we need to verify if all 122 were indeed released by the Obama Administration and if they all returned to the battlefield as implied.

## Step 7: Conclusion
The statement might be misleading because it implies all 122 prisoners were released by the Obama Administration, which could be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the facts.

The statement claims that Senator Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Iran Deal, even disagreeing with President Obama, and then voted against it. However, now Schumer supposedly says that Trump should not have terminated the deal.

## Step 2: Verify Schumer's stance on the Iran Deal
Historically, Senator Chuck Schumer did express reservations about the Iran Deal. In 2015, he announced that he would oppose the deal, citing concerns about its ability to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and its impact on the region.

## Step 3: Check Schumer's vote on the Iran Deal
Schumer did indeed vote against the Iran Deal in 2015. The Senate voted on a resolution of disapproval regarding the agreement, and Schumer was among those who voted in favor of the resolution, which was a vote against the deal.

## Step 4: Assess Schumer's comments on Trump terminating the deal
After Trump announced the withdrawal from the Iran Deal in 2018, Schumer criticized the decision, suggesting it was a mistake and could lead to negative consequences, including increased tensions and potentially pushing Iran towards developing nuclear weapons.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the facts, Schumer did oppose the Iran Deal and voted against it. However, the statement implies a contradiction in Schumer's stance that is not entirely accurate. Schumer's opposition to the deal initially and his later criticism of Trump's decision to withdraw from it are based on different aspects of the agreement and its implications at different times.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement takes Schumer's initial opposition to the deal and his later criticism of Trump's withdrawal out of context, suggesting a flip-flop that does not fully account for the complexities of his positions over time.

The statement claims that Deborah Birx traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving, her family called the police and turned her in, and then she resigned.

According to reports, Deborah Birx did travel to her vacation home in Delaware for Thanksgiving in 2020, which was during a time when she was advising Americans to limit their holiday gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is no evidence to suggest that her family called the police on her or that she was ""turned in"" as a result of this visit.

## Step 3: Determine the outcome of Deborah Birx's actions
Deborah Birx did face criticism for her decision to travel during the pandemic, which seemed to contradict her own public health advice. However, she did not resign immediately after the incident. She eventually retired from her position as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator in January 2021, after Joe Biden took office.

## Step 2: Consider the context and facts surrounding the statement
In 2010, the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, acquired a majority stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company with uranium mining operations in the United States. This deal was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which includes representatives from several U.S. government agencies, including the State Department, which was led by Secretary Hillary Clinton at the time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the quantity and the implications
The claim that this deal resulted in giving up ""20 percent of America's uranium supply"" to Russia is misleading. While it is true that Uranium One had mining rights in the United States, the actual amount of uranium that could be extracted and its significance in the context of the total U.S. uranium supply needs clarification. Moreover, the deal did not directly transfer uranium to Russia but rather gave a Russian company control over mines in the United States.

## Step 4: Assess the role of Hillary Clinton
Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was one of the members of the CFIUS, but she did not have the sole authority to approve the deal. The decision to approve the acquisition was made by the full committee, and there is no evidence to suggest that Clinton personally ""gave up"" any uranium or that she had the authority to do so unilaterally.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Given the information and the context, the statement is misleading and omits critical facts. It inaccurately suggests a direct transfer of a significant portion of the U.S. uranium supply to Russia due to Hillary Clinton's actions, which is not supported by the facts. The deal involved a Canadian company with U.S. mining operations, and the approval process was a multi-agency decision, not a unilateral action by Clinton.

The key claim in the statement is that many car plants are being built all throughout the United States after decades of not having any new plants built.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on June 30, 2019, by Donald Trump. This context is important for verifying the claim as it specifies the time frame in which the statement should be evaluated.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim of no car plants being built in decades
Before Trump's presidency, which began in 2017, there were indeed periods where the construction of new car plants in the United States was less frequent, especially during and after the 2008 financial crisis. However, it's not entirely accurate to say no plants were built in decades. For example, in the early 2000s, there were investments and expansions in the automotive sector, including the construction of new facilities by foreign automakers.

## Step 4: Assess the claim of many plants being built during Trump's presidency
During Trump's presidency, there were announcements and investments in the automotive sector, including the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of new ones. For instance, companies like Toyota, Volkswagen, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) made significant investments in the United States. However, the extent to which these investments constituted ""many plants being built all throughout the United States"" needs clarification.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information, while there is some truth to the statement that new investments and plant constructions were happening, the claim of ""many plants"" and the implication that this was a stark reversal of decades of inactivity might be exaggerated. The automotive industry did see investments, but saying ""many plants"" were being built could be misleading without specific numbers or context.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the steps above, the statement contains an element of truth but might ignore critical facts or exaggerate the scale of new plant constructions. Therefore, it does not fully align with being completely true or false but leans towards being partially accurate with significant omissions or exaggerations.

The statement made by Eric Cantor on 6/28/2012 claims that due to the health care act, people who have health care and like it will not be able to keep what they have.

## Step 2: Consider the context and the health care act being referred to
Given the date of the statement (6/28/2012), it is likely referring to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was passed in 2010 and whose constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court just a few days before the statement was made.

## Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the ACA on existing health care plans
The ACA allowed young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions, and required all citizens to have health insurance or face a penalty. However, it also included a provision that allowed people to keep their existing plans if they were in place before the law was passed, known as ""grandfathering.""

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the statement
While the ACA did introduce significant changes to the health care system, the statement that people who have health care and like it will not be able to keep what they have is misleading. The law included provisions to allow individuals to keep their existing plans under certain conditions. However, changes in the insurance market and adjustments by insurance companies could still result in changes to plans, even if the law itself did not directly force individuals off their plans.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Given the information and the context, the statement is not entirely accurate because it simplifies the impact of the ACA on existing health care plans. The ACA did allow for the continuation of existing plans under certain conditions, but the statement implies a more absolute disruption than actually occurred for many people. Therefore, the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The statement claims that in 2008, Charlie Crist applauded the pick of Sarah Palin and said she would do a great job. This statement is attributed to George LeMieux and was made on 8/28/2012.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential biases
The statement is made by George LeMieux, who might have political motivations or biases, especially considering the date and the context of political campaigns or discussions around that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of evidence
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we would need evidence from 2008, such as quotes, interviews, or public statements from Charlie Crist regarding Sarah Palin's selection as a vice-presidential candidate.

## Step 4: Consider the nature of political statements
Political statements, especially those made during or in reference to election seasons, can be subject to spin, selective memory, or outright fabrication. It's crucial to verify such claims through reputable sources.

## Step 5: Assess the statement based on known facts and context
Without direct access to archives or specific quotes from Charlie Crist in 2008 regarding Sarah Palin, we must consider the possibility that the statement could be true, false, or somewhere in between. However, given the political context and the potential for selective or misleading information, caution is warranted.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the criteria provided
Given the lack of direct evidence provided here and the potential for political spin, the most appropriate label, based on the information given and the need for verification, would lean towards a cautious assessment.

The statement claims that Social Security was advocated in the 1930s as a way to get people to quit working due to a perceived permanent scarcity of jobs in the country.

## Step 2: Historical context of Social Security
Social Security was introduced in the 1930s as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs. The primary goal was to provide financial assistance to the elderly, the disabled, and the unemployed, aiming to alleviate poverty and ensure a basic level of economic security.

## Step 3: Purpose of Social Security
The main purpose of Social Security was not to encourage people to quit working but to provide a safety net for those who were no longer able to work due to age or disability and to support those who were unemployed due to economic conditions.

## Step 4: Economic conditions of the 1930s
The 1930s were marked by the Great Depression, a period of severe economic downturn. The idea of a permanent scarcity of jobs was a concern during this time, but the introduction of Social Security was more about addressing immediate economic hardship rather than promoting retirement as a solution to job scarcity.

## Step 5: Evaluation of the statement
Given the historical context and the primary goals of Social Security, the statement that it was advocated as a way to get people to quit working due to a perceived permanent scarcity of jobs is misleading. While the economic conditions of the time were a factor, the program's purpose was more about providing economic security than encouraging retirement as a job market solution.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement contains an element of truth in that economic conditions were a concern, but it ignores critical facts about the program's actual purpose and goals. Therefore, it does not accurately represent the reasons behind the advocacy for Social Security.

The statement given is ""Forty-five percent of doctors 'say they'll quit' if health care reform passes"" from Glenn Beck, dated 10/12/2009.

## Step 2: Evaluate the context of the statement
The statement was made in 2009, a time when health care reform was a significant topic of discussion in the United States, particularly with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) being debated.

## Step 3: Assess the credibility of the source
Glenn Beck is known for his conservative views and has been involved in controversies regarding the accuracy of information presented on his show. This context is important when evaluating the credibility of the statement.

## Step 4: Consider available evidence and fact-checking
A survey by the Medicus Firm in 2009 did suggest that a significant percentage of physicians might consider quitting or reducing their practice if the health care reform passed, but the exact figure of 45% and the context in which doctors would ""quit"" need clarification. Other surveys and fact-checking organizations have scrutinized such claims, often finding them to be exaggerated or taken out of context.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the potential for the statement to be misleading or exaggerated, and considering the source, it's essential to approach this claim with skepticism. The statement might be based on a real survey, but the presentation could be misleading or lack necessary context.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Considering the potential for the statement to be partially accurate but possibly misleading or lacking in context, and given the source's credibility issues, the statement is best labeled as ""half true.""

The statement claims that Dontre Hamilton was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee.

## Step 2: Verify the incident details
Dontre Hamilton was indeed shot by a police officer in Milwaukee, but the details of the incident need to be verified for accuracy, including the number of shots and the circumstances.

## Step 3: Research the incident
According to reports and investigations, Dontre Hamilton was shot on April 30, 2014, by Milwaukee Police Officer Christopher Manney. The incident occurred in Red Arrow Park, where Hamilton was resting. The investigation and subsequent reports confirmed that Hamilton was shot 14 times.

## Step 4: Evaluate the context and accuracy of the statement
Given that the statement was made on June 29, 2017, and considering the verified details of the incident, the statement appears to be accurate in terms of the number of shots and the location. However, the context of the shooting might be more complex, involving a confrontation between Hamilton and the officer, which might not be fully captured by the statement.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the verified facts, the statement is accurate regarding the number of shots and the location.

The statement claims that the problem of nuclear waste has been solved and scientists are advising to leave the nuclear waste where it is.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement is 2/19/2010, we need to consider the state of nuclear waste management and scientific consensus around that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim of solving the nuclear waste problem
As of 2010, the problem of nuclear waste was (and still is) a significant challenge. The claim that it has been ""solved"" seems overly optimistic and not reflective of the ongoing debates and efforts to manage nuclear waste safely.

## Step 4: Assess the advice to leave nuclear waste where it is
The advice to leave nuclear waste where it is contradicts the general consensus in the scientific community and among regulatory bodies, which typically advocate for the safe storage and disposal of nuclear waste to prevent environmental and health hazards.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim that the nuclear waste problem was solved by 2010 and the contradictory nature of the advice to leave nuclear waste where it is, the statement appears to be misleading and not supported by factual evidence.

The key claim is that between 27,000 and 200,000 Wisconsinites were ""turned away"" from the polls in 2016 due to lack of proper identification.

## Step 2: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Hillary Clinton, a political figure, which may indicate potential bias or a specific perspective on the issue.

## Step 3: Evaluate the context of the statement
The statement was made on 9/17/2019, more than two years after the 2016 election. This timing could imply that the statement is based on post-election analysis or studies.

## Step 4: Assess the available data and research on voter turnout and ID laws in Wisconsin for 2016
Studies and data analyses from reputable sources, such as the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have examined the impact of voter ID laws on voter turnout. These studies often provide estimates of voters who may have been deterred or unable to vote due to ID requirements.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on available evidence
Research indicates that voter ID laws can indeed affect voter turnout, particularly among certain demographics. However, the specific numbers provided in the statement (between 27,000 and 200,000) need to be verified against academic studies and official reports to assess their accuracy.

## Step 6: Consider the range of the estimate
The wide range (27,000 to 200,000) suggests uncertainty or variability in the data or methodologies used to estimate the number of voters turned away. This range may reflect different assumptions or studies with differing conclusions.

## Step 7: Evaluate the statement against fact-checking criteria
Given the potential for the statement to be based on real concerns about voter ID laws affecting turnout, but also considering the need for precise data to support the specific numbers claimed, the statement may not be entirely accurate without further clarification or evidence.

The statement claims that between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls in Wisconsin in 2016 due to the color of their skin and other factors, because a key provision of the Voting Rights Act was not in effect.

## Step 2: Consider the context and the source of the statement
The statement was made by Hillary Clinton on March 3, 2019. The context is about the impact of voting laws on voter turnout, specifically in Wisconsin during the 2016 election.

## Step 3: Evaluate the factual basis of the statement
Research indicates that Wisconsin's voter ID law, which was in effect during the 2016 election, did have a disproportionate impact on certain groups, including racial minorities. However, quantifying the exact number of people turned away specifically because of the color of their skin and other factors as ""between 40,000 and 80,000"" requires precise data that may not be readily available or may be subject to interpretation.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy and potential for missing information
While it is true that voter ID laws can disproportionately affect minority voters, and Wisconsin's law was particularly strict, attributing a specific range of voters being turned away due to the color of their skin and other factors without clear, direct evidence may not fully capture the complexity of the issue. The statement may be based on studies or estimates, but without direct access to those sources, it's challenging to verify the exact numbers.

The key claim is that ""Not a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship"" as of the date of the statement, 5/5/2015.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of 5/5/2015, we are looking at the political landscape during the early stages of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This was a time when candidates were beginning to announce their intentions to run.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on known positions of Republican candidates at the time
As of May 2015, several Republican candidates had announced or were considering a run for the presidency. The positions on immigration, including paths to citizenship, varied among them. Some candidates had expressed support for certain forms of immigration reform that could include a path to citizenship under specific conditions, while others were more opposed to the idea.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the complexity of political positions and the evolving nature of campaign stances, it's challenging to assert that not a single Republican candidate supported a path to citizenship without considering the nuances of each candidate's platform. However, it is known that many Republican candidates at the time were cautious about endorsing a straightforward path to citizenship, especially without emphasizing border security and other prerequisites.

## Step 5: Consider notable Republican candidates' positions in 2015
Candidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio had expressed support for some form of immigration reform that could include a path to citizenship, albeit with conditions and not necessarily in a straightforward manner. Other candidates were more opposed, advocating for stricter immigration policies without a clear path to citizenship.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given the information and the need for clarification on what constitutes ""clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship,"" the statement might be seen as mostly true in the context of there being no Republican candidate openly and unconditionally supporting a path to citizenship. However, the statement could be misleading because it does not account for nuanced positions that might include a path to citizenship under certain conditions.

According to various reports and data from reputable sources such as the World Bank and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Afghanistan did experience some level of economic growth during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State (2009-2013). This growth was largely driven by international aid and investment in the country's infrastructure and security sectors.

## Step 2: Assess the claim about opium production in Afghanistan during the same period.
Data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) indicates that opium production in Afghanistan did fluctuate during Clinton's tenure. However, the overall trend during her time in office was not consistently downward. In fact, opium production saw significant increases in some years, making the claim of a decline somewhat misleading without additional context.

## Step 3: Examine the statement regarding infant mortality in Afghanistan.
Reports from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF suggest that infant mortality rates in Afghanistan did decline over the years, including during Clinton's time at the State Department. This decline can be attributed to improved healthcare services and international aid targeted at maternal and child health.

## Step 4: Investigate the claim about school enrollment in Afghanistan.
There was a significant increase in school enrollment in Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban in 2001, with enrollment numbers rising substantially, including during Clinton's tenure. This increase was due in part to international efforts to support education in the country, as well as the Afghan government's own initiatives.

## Step 5: Determine the overall accuracy of the statement based on the evaluations above.
Considering the evaluations, the statement contains elements of truth, such as economic growth, decline in infant mortality, and an increase in school enrollment. However, the claim about opium production being down is not entirely accurate without further context, as production levels fluctuated and did not consistently decrease during Clinton's time at the State Department.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 9/17/2007, which is during a significant period in U.S. political history, specifically during the lead-up to the 2008 presidential election. This context suggests that the statement is part of a political campaign or debate.

## Step 3: Evaluate the feasibility of the cost and the claim of paying for it with savings
Without specific details on how the $110-billion cost was calculated or what ""savings"" refers to, it's challenging to assess the accuracy directly. However, the concept of paying for a significant healthcare plan solely through savings is generally considered implausible without substantial cuts in other areas or significant increases in taxes or other revenue streams.

## Step 4: Consider the nature of political campaign promises
Political campaign promises, especially those related to complex issues like healthcare reform, often involve simplifications or projections that may not fully account for the complexities of implementation or the actual costs involved.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of detail on how the cost was estimated and how savings would cover such a significant expense, along with the general implausibility of such a claim without further context, the statement seems to lack substantial factual support or clarity.

The statement claims that the New START treaty cuts Russia's nuclear arms and was passed while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.

## Step 2: Verify the passage of New START and its purpose
New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was indeed a treaty between the United States and Russia aimed at reducing the number of nuclear arms. It was signed on April 8, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011. Hillary Clinton was the U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, which means she was in office when the treaty was signed and implemented.

## Step 3: Determine the accuracy of the statement regarding the treaty's effect on Russia's nuclear arms
New START did limit the number of strategic nuclear missiles, bombers, and launchers that both the U.S. and Russia could have. Therefore, it did indeed cut Russia's nuclear arms, among other limitations.

## Step 4: Assess the statement for truthfulness based on the verified information
Given that New START was passed during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state and that it did reduce Russia's nuclear arms, the statement is accurate. However, it's essential to consider if there are any missing details or context that could alter the interpretation of the statement's truthfulness.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential missing information

The statement claims that Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation and are dead last in funding per student, as stated by Hillary Clinton on 3/15/2016.

## Step 2: Determine the criteria for evaluation
To evaluate the statement, we need to consider the ranking of Arizona schools nationally and their funding per student at the time of the statement (2016).

## Step 3: Research the national ranking of Arizona schools in 2016
According to various reports and data from 2016, Arizona indeed ranked low in terms of education quality and funding. However, the exact ranking can vary depending on the source and the specific criteria used.

## Step 4: Research the funding per student in Arizona compared to other states in 2016
Data from 2016 indicates that Arizona was among the lowest in the nation in terms of funding per student. However, being ""dead last"" needs to be verified with specific data from that time.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the findings
Given that Arizona was known to have significant challenges with education funding and quality in 2016, and considering that rankings can fluctuate, the statement about Arizona schools ranking 45th and being dead last in funding per student needs to be assessed for its accuracy in the context of available data from 2016.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Without access to the exact data from 2016 to confirm the precise ranking and funding per student, we must consider the general context. Arizona was indeed struggling with education funding and quality around that time. However, the statement's specificity (45th in the nation and dead last in funding) requires precise data to confirm.

half-true,Hillary Clinton,"Says Bernie Sanders ""was against the auto bailout"" and ""voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.""",3/06/2016,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/07/hillary-clinton/michigan-hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-was-a/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that Bernie Sanders was against the auto bailout and voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.

## Step 2: Determine the context of the auto bailout
The auto bailout refers to the financial support provided by the U.S. government to the automotive industry during the 2008 financial crisis. This support was crucial for the survival of major American automakers.

## Step 3: Research Bernie Sanders' stance on the auto bailout
Bernie Sanders did vote against the initial bailout bill in December 2008, which was part of a larger $700 billion bailout package for the financial sector. However, he later supported a separate bill in January 2009 that provided $14 billion in loans to the auto industry, which was seen as crucial for saving the industry.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given that Sanders initially voted against the broader bailout package that included funds for the auto industry but later supported a bill specifically aimed at saving the auto industry, the statement simplifies his position and could be misleading. It does not fully capture the nuances of his voting record on the issue.

## Step 5: Consider the date and source of the statement
The statement was made by Hillary Clinton on 3/6/2016, during a presidential campaign. This context suggests that the statement might be used to contrast her position with Sanders' on economic issues, potentially leading to a simplification or spin of his actual stance.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given the information and the context, the statement is partially accurate but omits important details or takes things out of context. Therefore, it should be labeled as ""half true"" because it captures a part of Sanders' actions but does not fully represent his position on the auto bailout.

The key claim in the statement is that Hillary Clinton's campaign depends on small donations for the majority of its support.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data as of the statement's date (3/15/2016)
As of the date of the statement, March 15, 2016, we need to consider the financial reports and data available on Hillary Clinton's campaign funding. According to various reports and analyses from that time, Clinton's campaign did receive significant funding from small donors, but it also received substantial contributions from larger donors and super PACs.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on the available information
Given the information available as of March 15, 2016, while Clinton's campaign did receive support from small donations, it is also known that a significant portion of her campaign's funding came from larger donors and super PACs. This suggests that the statement might not fully capture the complexity of her campaign's funding sources.

## Step 4: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the information from the previous steps, the statement that ""Our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support"" could be seen as partially accurate but omitting important details about the role of larger donors and super PACs in funding Clinton's campaign. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate but does contain an element of truth.

The key claim is that President Donald Trump had not said anything as the President of the United States about bounties on American troops.

## Step 2: Consider the context and timing of the statement
The statement was made on July 20, 2020, by Hillary Clinton. This timing is crucial because it refers to a specific period when there were reports about Russia offering bounties to Taliban militants for killing American troops in Afghanistan.

## Step 3: Recall the public record on Trump's response to the bounty issue
As of the summer of 2020, there were indeed reports and concerns raised about Russian bounties on American troops. The Trump administration's response and Trump's personal statements on the matter were under scrutiny.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on known facts
Given the public record and the timeline, it is known that the Trump administration was criticized for its handling of the intelligence regarding Russian bounties. Trump himself was accused of not adequately addressing the issue publicly or taking sufficient action.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the information available up to July 20, 2020, and the criticism Trump faced for not publicly addressing the bounties on American troops, the statement appears to align with the public record of the time. However, the accuracy of the statement also depends on the specific actions and statements made by Trump up to that point, which might include any comments or actions not widely reported or recognized.

half-true,Hillary Clinton,"""The state that has the highest per capita number of  guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""",4/11/2016,other,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/apr/12/hillary-clinton/look-hillary-clintons-claim-about-vermonts-gun-pip/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the key claim in the statement
The key claim is that Vermont is the state with the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 4/11/2016 by Hillary Clinton. This context is important for evaluating the accuracy of the claim based on data available up to that point.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of data to support the claim
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we would need data on the origin of guns used in crimes in New York, specifically comparing per capita rates across different states. This data would typically come from law enforcement agencies, such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) or state-specific crime reports.

## Step 4: Consider the plausibility of Vermont being the source of a high number of crime guns in New York
Vermont has relatively lax gun laws compared to New York, which could potentially make it a source of guns used in crimes in New York. However, the claim about per capita rates requires specific data to confirm.

## Step 5: Assess the statement based on known facts and data availability
Without direct access to the specific data that would confirm the per capita rate of guns from Vermont used in crimes in New York as of 2016, we must consider the general plausibility and the context in which the statement was made. Given that gun trafficking patterns can vary and that Vermont's laws could facilitate the movement of guns into New York, the statement could have some basis in fact. However, the lack of specific data to support the ""per capita"" claim introduces uncertainty.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Given the potential for some basis in fact but lacking specific data to fully support the claim, especially the per capita aspect, the statement is likely not entirely accurate without further clarification or data. It does not seem to be outright false but requires more information to be confirmed as true.

FALSE,Hillary Clinton,"The Benghazi probe is ""the longest-running congressional investigation ever.""",9/30/2015,campaign,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/oct/02/hillary-clinton/clinton-campaign-benghazi-probe-congress-longest-i/,mostly true,"## Step 1: Identify the key claim in the statement
The key claim is that the Benghazi probe is ""the longest-running congressional investigation ever.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on September 30, 2015, by Hillary Clinton. This context is important for verifying the claim as it specifies the time frame in which the statement was made.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on historical data
As of 2015, the Benghazi probe, which started in 2014, was indeed one of the longest-running congressional investigations. However, determining if it was the ""longest-running"" requires comparing its duration to that of other significant congressional investigations up to that point.

## Step 4: Compare with other investigations
Other notable long-running investigations include the Church Committee (1975-1976), the Iran-Contra affair investigation (1986-1987), and the Watergate scandal investigation (1972-1974). However, the duration of these investigations might not surpass that of the Benghazi probe by 2015.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Hillary Clinton, who was directly involved in the Benghazi incident as the Secretary of State at the time of the attack. Her perspective might be influenced by her personal involvement and the political context.

## Step 6: Assess the truthfulness of the statement
Given the information available up to 2015 and considering the durations of other significant investigations, the Benghazi probe was indeed one of the longest, if not the longest, running at that time. However, without exact durations of all investigations for comparison, the statement might slightly overstate or be an accurate reflection of the situation as of 2015.

## Step 7: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement seems to be accurate based on the information available at the time it was made. However, the absolute nature of the claim (""the longest-running"") might require clarification or additional context for complete verification.

half-true,JB Pritzker,"Says states with graduated income taxes ""create jobs and grow their economies faster"" than Illinois.",5/01/2019,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/19/jb-pritzker/pritzkers-latest-sweeping-tax-claim-falls-flat/,error,"## Step 1: Understanding the Statement
The statement claims that states with graduated income taxes create jobs and grow their economies faster than Illinois. This implies a comparison between the economic performance of states with graduated income tax systems and Illinois, which at the time of the statement (May 1, 2019), had a flat income tax rate.

## Step 2: Evaluating Economic Growth and Job Creation
Economic growth and job creation can be influenced by a multitude of factors including tax policies, investment in education and infrastructure, business environment, and technological innovation. A graduated income tax, where higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate than lower income earners, can potentially impact these factors in various ways. It can increase government revenue, which can be used to fund public goods and services that benefit businesses and individuals, potentially stimulating economic growth. However, it can also discourage high-income individuals and businesses from locating in such states, potentially hindering job creation and economic growth.

## Step 3: Considering the Context of Illinois
As of the statement's date (May 1, 2019), Illinois had a flat income tax rate. The comparison made by JB Pritzker, the source of the statement, suggests that adopting a graduated income tax could improve Illinois' economic performance relative to other states. This implies that the economic conditions, job market, and growth rates in states with graduated income taxes are being compared to those in Illinois.

## Step 4: Assessing the Availability of Data
To verify the statement, one would need data on the economic growth rates and job creation in states with graduated income taxes compared to Illinois. This data would include GDP growth, unemployment rates, and possibly other economic indicators. The statement's accuracy would depend on whether such data supports the claim that states with graduated income taxes outperform Illinois economically.

## Step 5: Determining the Statement's Accuracy
Without specific data or studies cited in the statement, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as true or false based solely on the information provided. However, the claim that graduated income taxes lead to faster job creation and economic growth is a topic of economic debate. Some studies suggest that progressive taxation can lead to more equitable economic growth, while others argue it can deter investment and job creation. The statement simplifies a complex issue and does not account for the myriad factors influencing state economies.

The statement claims that Perdue mismanaged Pillowtex, resulting in nearly 8,000 people getting laid off.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available information
As of the given date (7/1/2014), we need to assess if there's evidence that Perdue was involved with Pillowtex and if the company experienced significant layoffs due to mismanagement.

## Step 3: Evaluate the source of the statement
The statement is attributed to Jack Kingston, who may have a political or personal motive for making such a claim, especially if it's related to a political campaign or debate involving Perdue.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Without specific details on Perdue's involvement with Pillowtex and the circumstances of the layoffs, it's challenging to verify the statement's accuracy directly. However, it's known that Pillowtex did experience significant financial difficulties and layoffs. The key is whether Perdue's management was the cause and if the number of layoffs is accurate.

## Step 5: Consider the potential for bias or missing context
Given that the statement comes from a potentially adversarial source (Jack Kingston), there might be a bias in how the information is presented. The statement could be missing context about the circumstances leading to the layoffs or the overall economic conditions at the time.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the available information and criteria
Given the potential for the statement to be partially accurate but lacking in specific details or context, and considering it might be used to criticize Perdue, the most appropriate label would reflect that the statement has some basis in fact but may not tell the whole story or may be presented in a way that is misleading.

The statement made by Jeb Bush on 8/27/2015 is ""I released all my emails."" This implies that he has made all of his emails publicly available.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential implications
Releasing all emails could be a significant act, especially for a public figure like Jeb Bush, as it pertains to transparency and accountability. However, the statement's accuracy depends on whether he indeed released every single email or if there were exceptions.

## Step 3: Evaluate the possibility of omitted information
Given the nature of the statement, it's possible that not all emails were released, especially if some were deemed personal, classified, or irrelevant to public interest. Without specific details on what emails were released and which were not, the statement could be misleading.

## Step 4: Assess the statement based on the provided criteria
Considering the criteria for labeling the statement, we must determine if it is true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, or implausible based on the information given and the context of email releases by public figures.

## Step 5: Apply the criteria to the statement
Given that the statement lacks specificity and considering the common practice of public figures releasing selected emails rather than every single one, the claim ""I released all my emails"" is likely an overstatement. Without evidence that every email was indeed released, the statement cannot be taken at face value.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
The statement is likely not entirely accurate because it implies a completeness that may not exist. Public figures often release emails related to specific topics or periods but may withhold others for various reasons. Thus, the statement is not entirely false but also not entirely true without further clarification.

The key claim is that Jeb Bush won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes in 2002, with 60 percent of the Hispanic vote in the state.

## Step 2: Determine the context and relevance of the date
The statement was made on 7/27/2015, but it refers to an event in 2002. This means we need to verify the voting data from 2002 to assess the claim's accuracy.

## Step 3: Assess the availability of data to verify the claim
To verify the claim, we would need access to the voting data from 2002, specifically the breakdown of votes by ethnicity. This data might be available through official election records or analyses from that time.

## Step 4: Evaluate the claim based on known information
Without direct access to the 2002 voting data in this format, we must rely on general knowledge and any publicly available information that might confirm or deny Jeb Bush's performance among Hispanic voters in 2002.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Jeb Bush himself, which might introduce a bias. However, as a public figure, his claims can be subject to scrutiny and fact-checking by media and other sources.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of direct evidence provided here and the potential for the statement to be verifiable through election data, we cannot conclusively label the statement as true or false without access to the specific voting data from 2002. However, considering that the statement is about a specific, verifiable event and assuming it could be checked against historical election data, if the data supports the claim, it would be true. If not, it would be false. Since we cannot verify the claim directly in this format and the statement refers to a specific, potentially verifiable event, the most appropriate approach is to consider the nature of the claim and the typical process for verifying such statements.

The statement is made by Jeb Bush on February 2, 2016, regarding the national debt and its discussion in town meetings versus debates.

## Step 2: Consider the nature of the statement
The statement reflects on the frequency of discussions about the national debt in two different settings: town meetings and debates, suggesting a discrepancy in how often the topic is brought up in these contexts.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy
Without specific data on every town meeting and debate that occurred up to February 2, 2016, it's challenging to verify the absolute accuracy of Bush's statement. However, the statement's subjective nature (""it's really weird"") and the general observation about the debt being discussed in town meetings but not in debates could be based on Bush's personal experience or observations.

## Step 4: Consider the potential for the statement to be true or false
Given that the statement is based on Bush's personal experience and perception, it could be seen as an accurate reflection of his observations, even if it doesn't apply universally. The lack of specific examples or data to support the claim makes it difficult to categorize as entirely true.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label
Considering the subjective nature of the statement and the lack of concrete evidence to support or refute it, the statement seems to be more of a personal observation than a factually verifiable claim.

The statement claims that eliminating affirmative action in admissions in Florida led to an increase in the number of African American and Hispanic students attending the university system. This statement was made by Jeb Bush on February 27, 2015.

## Step 2: Consider the implications of affirmative action
Affirmative action policies are designed to promote diversity and inclusion by providing opportunities for underrepresented groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics, in education and employment. Eliminating such policies could potentially reduce the number of students from these groups attending universities, as they might face more competition without the affirmative action considerations.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available data and research on the topic
Research on the effects of eliminating affirmative action in university admissions has shown mixed results, but many studies suggest that such actions can lead to a decrease in diversity, as fewer students from underrepresented groups are admitted. However, the specific outcome can depend on various factors, including the implementation of alternative diversity-promoting strategies.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy based on known facts and research
Given the general understanding of affirmative action's purpose and the potential effects of its elimination, the statement seems counterintuitive to the expected outcomes. However, without specific data from Florida during the relevant period, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as false. It's possible that Florida implemented other strategies to maintain or increase diversity, which could support the claim. Yet, the statement lacks clarity on what specific actions were taken to achieve the claimed outcome.

## Step 5: Consider the source and potential biases
The statement comes from Jeb Bush, a political figure who might have a vested interest in presenting the outcome of policy changes in a positive light. This could introduce a bias in the presentation of facts.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the potential for the statement to be misleading without additional context, and considering the general understanding of the effects of eliminating affirmative action, the statement seems to omit important details or takes things out of context. It suggests a positive outcome that is not typically associated with the elimination of affirmative action policies, without providing evidence of how this outcome was achieved.

The key claim is that ""California has added twice as many jobs as Florida"" over the past year, according to Jerry Brown.

## Step 2: Determine the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on April 26, 2016, by Jerry Brown, who is likely referring to the job market situation in California and Florida up to that point.

## Step 3: Consider the available data and sources for verification
To verify the statement, we would need to look at job market data from reputable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for both California and Florida, specifically focusing on the period from April 2015 to April 2016.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on available data
Without access to real-time data or specific job market statistics from 2015-2016, we cannot directly verify the accuracy of the statement. However, we can consider the general approach to fact-checking such claims. Typically, statements like these can be verified by comparing the net change in employment numbers over the specified period in both states.

## Step 5: Consider the potential for the statement to be true or false
Given that economic data can fluctuate and that both California and Florida are large states with diverse economies, it's plausible that one could have added more jobs than the other over a given period. However, without specific numbers, we cannot definitively label the statement as true or false.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the available information
Since we lack specific data to confirm or deny the statement and considering the nature of economic data which can support a wide range of outcomes, the most appropriate approach is to consider the statement as potentially accurate but unverified due to lack of specific data.

The key claim is that West Virginia's highways rank 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, which is an improvement of 20 spots from the previous year's ranking.

## Step 2: Consider the source of the statement
The statement is made by Jim Justice, who is likely a public figure or official in West Virginia, given the context of the statement.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of evidence to support the claim
Without access to the specific national survey of highway systems mentioned or the previous year's ranking, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim directly.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility of the claim
Improving by 20 spots in a national ranking in one year is a significant improvement and suggests a substantial effort in fixing the state's roads. However, without knowing the criteria used for the ranking or the specific actions taken, it's difficult to assess the plausibility based solely on the statement.

## Step 5: Consider the context and potential biases
The statement is made by a public official, which might introduce a bias towards presenting the state's achievements in a positive light. However, this does not inherently make the statement false, as it could still be based on factual data.

The statement was made by Joe Manchin about John Raese's wife on October 8, 2010. This context suggests a political setting, possibly during an election campaign.

## Step 2: Evaluate the claim about voting registration
The claim is that John Raese's wife is registered to vote in Florida, which allegedly prevents her from voting for him. This implies that John Raese is running in an election outside of Florida, and his wife's voting registration in Florida would indeed prevent her from voting for him in that election.

## Step 3: Consider the relevance of voting registration location
In the United States, voting registration is typically tied to the state and sometimes the county where a person resides. If John Raese's wife is registered to vote in Florida, it means she is registered in a state different from where John Raese is presumably running (since he is the one being discussed in relation to an election).

## Step 4: Assess the truthfulness based on available information
Without specific details on where John Raese was running for office, we can still infer that if his wife is registered to vote in Florida and he is running in a different state, she would indeed not be able to vote for him in that election due to her voting registration being in a different state.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on the analysis
Given the information provided and the context, the statement seems to be factually accurate. The critical factor is the location of John Raese's election campaign and his wife's voting registration. If she is registered in Florida and he is running in another state, the statement is true.

The statement claims that since Barack Obama became president, 95 percent of economic gains have been made by the richest 1 percent.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on January 21, 2014. This means we need to look at economic data from 2009 (when Obama took office) up to 2014 to assess the claim.

## Step 3: Evaluate the economic data and research from that period
Research from that time, including studies by economists like Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty, has shown that the wealthiest Americans did indeed capture a disproportionate share of the economic gains during the recovery from the Great Recession.

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the specific percentage claim
The claim of ""95 percent of economic gains"" going to the ""richest 1 percent"" is a specific figure that needs verification. Studies and data from the period, such as those from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) and other economic research institutions, have supported the notion that the top 1% of earners in the United States experienced a significant proportion of the income gains during the initial years of the recovery.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the assessment
Given the evidence and the context, the statement that ""Since Barack Obama became president of the United States, 95 percent of economic gains have been made by the richest 1 percent"" is generally supported by economic research and data from the period.

The statement compares the impact of creating jobs in Umatilla County to creating jobs in the metro region, suggesting that 25 jobs in Umatilla County have the same impact as 500 jobs in the metro region.

## Step 2: Consider the source and date
The statement is attributed to John Kitzhaber, who was the Governor of Oregon at the time of the statement (2011). This suggests that the statement might be based on some form of economic analysis or understanding of regional economic impacts.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim
The claim seems to imply that the economic or social impact of job creation is not linear and can vary significantly by location. This could be due to factors like the size of the local economy, the unemployment rate, the industry of the jobs, and the multiplier effect of job creation in different areas.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility
Without specific data or a detailed economic analysis provided in the statement, it's challenging to directly verify the claim. However, the concept that job creation in smaller or more rural areas can have a disproportionately larger impact compared to urban areas is plausible. This is because smaller communities may have fewer jobs overall, and the addition of 25 jobs could significantly affect local employment rates and economic activity.

## Step 5: Consider the need for clarification or additional information
The statement lacks specific details about how the impact is measured (e.g., economic output, employment rates, community development). It also does not account for the types of jobs, their wages, or the industries they are in, which could significantly influence the actual impact.

## Step 6: Determine the label
Given the lack of specific data or context and considering the plausibility of the concept, the statement seems to require clarification or additional information to be fully understood or verified. It does not seem entirely false or implausible but needs more details to assess its accuracy fully.

The statement claims that the IRS is planning to hire 19,500 new employees to administer Obama's health care mandate.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 10/11/2011, and it refers to the health care mandate, which is part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) signed into law by President Obama in 2010.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available information about the IRS and the ACA
At the time of the statement, there were discussions and plans for the implementation of the ACA, including the role of the IRS in administering certain aspects of the law, such as tax credits and penalties.

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the specific claim about new IRS employees
The claim of 19,500 new employees is specific and requires verification. According to reports and fact-checking from that time, the IRS did plan to hire additional staff to handle the new responsibilities under the ACA, but the exact number of 19,500 was not consistently verified across all sources.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement based on the evaluation
Given that there was a plan for the IRS to hire more employees due to the ACA, but the specific number of 19,500 might not be universally confirmed or could be subject to change, the statement is partially accurate but may lack precision or omit important details.

The statement made by Kamala Harris on 1/27/2019 is: ""The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren't keeping up."" This statement has two main components: the increase in the cost of living and the lack of corresponding increase in paychecks.

## Step 2: Evaluate the first component - the increase in the cost of living
As of 2019, there was evidence to suggest that the cost of living was indeed increasing. This can be attributed to various factors such as inflation, increases in housing costs, healthcare, and other necessities.

## Step 3: Evaluate the second component - paychecks not keeping up
The second part of the statement concerns the stagnation of paycheck growth in relation to the cost of living. In the years leading up to 2019, there were reports and studies indicating that wage growth had not kept pace with inflation and the increasing cost of living for many Americans.

## Step 4: Consider the context and available data
Given the date of the statement (1/27/2019), it's essential to consider economic data from around that time. The U.S. economy was experiencing a period of growth, but there were also concerns about income inequality and the purchasing power of the average consumer.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Based on the general economic trends and data available up to 2019, it is reasonable to conclude that the cost of living was increasing, and for many individuals, their paychecks were not increasing at a rate that would allow them to keep up with these rising costs.

## Step 6: Label the statement
Given the information and context, the statement appears to be accurate in reflecting a common experience for many people. However, the statement is broad and does not account for variations in individual circumstances or specific sectors of the economy that might have seen better wage growth.

The statement claims that Jeff Greene is the ""king of the undercover Credit Default Swap"" and implies that his actions contributed significantly to the economic destruction at the time of the statement (2010).

## Step 2: Understand the context of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and their role in the economy
Credit Default Swaps are financial instruments that allow investors to bet on the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. They were heavily involved in the 2008 financial crisis, as they allowed for speculation on mortgage-backed securities, which many believed would default. This speculation and the subsequent defaults led to a significant destabilization of the financial markets.

## Step 3: Research Jeff Greene's involvement with Credit Default Swaps
Jeff Greene, an American businessman and politician, was indeed involved in the real estate and financial markets. He made significant profits from betting against the housing market through the use of Credit Default Swaps before the 2008 financial crisis.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
While Jeff Greene did profit from the housing market collapse by using Credit Default Swaps, labeling him as the ""king of the undercover Credit Default Swap"" that single-handedly brought about the destruction of the economy is an exaggeration. The 2008 financial crisis was a complex event with multiple causes and contributors, including deregulation, subprime lending, and excessive speculation by numerous financial institutions and investors.

## Step 5: Consider the source and date of the statement
The statement was made by Kendrick Meek, a political opponent of Jeff Greene's during their 2010 Democratic primary race for the U.S. Senate in Florida. This context suggests that the statement might be politically motivated and intended to discredit Greene.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Given the information, the statement contains an element of truth in that Jeff Greene did profit from the use of Credit Default Swaps related to the housing market. However, it ignores critical facts about the broader causes of the financial crisis and exaggerates Greene's role, making it misleading.

FALSE,Kevin McCarthy,"Raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour ""would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.""",2/09/2021,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the claim and its source
The claim is that raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs, made by Kevin McCarthy on 2/9/2021.

## Step 2: Evaluate the context and available data
As of the given date, there were various studies and debates about the impact of raising the minimum wage on employment. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had released reports on the potential effects of minimum wage increases, including a 2019 report that estimated raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 could result in a loss of 1.3 million jobs, but also acknowledged that the impact could range from a very small loss to a loss of up to 3.7 million jobs, depending on the assumptions used.

## Step 3: Consider the accuracy of the statement
Given the CBO's report, the statement that raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour could destroy up to 3.7 million jobs is based on a possible scenario presented by the CBO. However, it is crucial to note that this figure represents the upper end of the estimated job loss range and not the most likely outcome according to the CBO's analysis.

## Step 4: Determine the label for the statement
The statement is partially accurate because it references a possible outcome from a credible source (the CBO). However, it lacks context by not mentioning that the 3.7 million job loss figure is at the higher end of the estimated range and does not reflect the most probable outcome according to the CBO's report. Therefore, the statement could be misleading without additional context.

The statement claims that Mexican government officials distribute brochures that provide instructions on how to evade the U.S. Border Patrol and enter the country.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential evidence
Given the date (5/20/2010) and the source (Lamar Smith), we need to assess if there were any reports, investigations, or evidence that support or refute the claim about the Mexican government handing out such brochures.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility based on known practices and policies
It is essential to consider the policies and practices of the Mexican government regarding immigration and border control around the time of the statement. If there were instances where the Mexican government was accused of or acknowledged providing guidance to migrants, this could support the statement's plausibility.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy based on available information
Without specific evidence or credible sources confirming the distribution of such brochures by Mexican government officials, the statement's accuracy is questionable. The claim seems to be more of an allegation than a fact-supported statement.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Given the lack of concrete evidence and considering the nature of the claim, the statement appears to be more of an assertion without substantial factual backing. Therefore, it leans towards being inaccurate or misleading without further context or evidence.

The statement claims that for the first time in history, Wisconsin has more government jobs than manufacturing jobs.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 10/9/2010, which means we need to consider the economic and employment situation in Wisconsin around that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility of the statement
Given the economic trends and the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on manufacturing jobs, it's plausible that government jobs could have surpassed manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin by 2010 due to job losses in the manufacturing sector.

## Step 4: Assess the need for factual support
To label the statement accurately, we would ideally need data from 2010 or around that time comparing the number of government jobs to manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the statement
The statement is from Leah Vukmir, a political figure, which might indicate a potential bias or a specific agenda behind the statement. However, this does not inherently make the statement false.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on available information
Without specific data to confirm or deny the statement, we must consider the context and the possibility that such a shift could have occurred. Given the economic climate of the time, it's conceivable that Wisconsin could have experienced a shift where government jobs outnumbered manufacturing jobs for the first time.

The statement claims that taking every penny from the 1 percent, including their assets (symbolized by ""including their dog""), would not be enough to balance the budget.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date
The statement was made on 3/8/2015 by Lindsey Graham. This date is important for understanding the economic context and the budget situation at that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the wealth of the 1 percent and the budget deficit at the time. The 1 percent refers to the wealthiest 1% of the population, who hold a significant portion of the country's wealth.

## Step 4: Research the budget and wealth distribution
As of 2015, the budget deficit and the total wealth of the 1 percent would need to be considered. The budget deficit for 2015 was approximately $439 billion. The total wealth of the 1 percent is more complex to calculate but is a significant portion of the national wealth.

## Step 5: Analyze the feasibility
Taking ""every penny"" of the 1 percent would theoretically include all their income, savings, and assets. However, the practicality and legality of such an action are not considered in the statement. The focus is on whether it would balance the budget.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available data
Given the significant wealth disparity and the size of the budget deficit, the statement's accuracy depends on the specific numbers. However, it's known that the wealth of the 1 percent is substantial, but whether it's enough to cover the entire budget deficit requires precise figures.

## Step 7: Final assessment
Without exact figures from 2015 on the total wealth of the 1 percent and considering the statement's nature, it seems to be an exaggeration or simplification. The idea that confiscating all wealth from the 1 percent wouldn't balance the budget might be misleading or not entirely accurate without considering the complexity of the economy and budget.

The statement is made by Lloyd Doggett on April 14, 2012, regarding his representation of about half the San Antonio-rooted district in which he seeks election.

## Step 2: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy
To determine the accuracy of the statement, we need to consider the context of the election and the districts involved. Lloyd Doggett is a U.S. Representative from Texas, and his statement pertains to his representation of a portion of the San Antonio area.

## Step 3: Consider the date and source of the statement
Given that the statement was made in 2012, we need to consider the district boundaries and representation at that time. Lloyd Doggett has been a U.S. Representative for Texas's 25th congressional district (previously the 10th and 25th districts due to redistricting) and has represented parts of the San Antonio area.

## Step 4: Assess the representation claim
Without specific details on the exact boundaries and the percentage of the district he claims to represent, it's challenging to verify the ""about half"" claim directly. However, considering Doggett's history of representing areas that include parts of San Antonio, there's a basis for his claim, given the redistricting that has occurred over the years.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the assessment
Given the information available and the context of the statement, the claim seems plausible but lacks specific details for full verification. However, considering Lloyd Doggett's known representation of areas including San Antonio, the statement is likely to have some basis in fact.

The statement claims that ""all those who do not answer directly to the president"" have said that repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell is a ""terrible idea."" This implies that individuals not directly under the president's authority have universally opposed the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on December 15, 2010. Don't Ask, Don't Tell was a policy in the US military that prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while also barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service. It was enacted in 1993 and repealed in 2010, with the repeal signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 22, 2010.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim of universal opposition
Given the diverse range of opinions on the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, it is highly unlikely that ""all those who do not answer directly to the president"" would universally agree that the repeal is a ""terrible idea."" This policy change was controversial and had supporters and opponents across various sectors, including the military, politicians, and the general public.

## Step 4: Assess the statement for factual accuracy
The claim of universal opposition among those not directly under the president's authority is an overstatement and not supported by the diverse opinions on the matter. While some individuals and groups did oppose the repeal, others supported it, indicating that the statement does not accurately reflect the range of opinions on the issue.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Given the lack of universal opposition and the diversity of opinions on the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the statement is not accurate. It misrepresents the views of those not directly under the president's authority by implying a uniformity of opinion that did not exist.

The claim is that Kelly Ayotte ""has voted to defund Planned Parenthood"" six times, made by Maggie Hassan on 4/8/2016. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to verify the number of times Kelly Ayotte voted to defund Planned Parenthood.

## Step 2: Research Kelly Ayotte's voting record on Planned Parenthood
According to various sources, including voting records and news articles from 2016, Kelly Ayotte did indeed vote multiple times to defund Planned Parenthood. These votes were often part of larger budget or healthcare bills.

## Step 3: Determine the accuracy of the number of votes
To label the statement as true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, or false, we need to confirm if Kelly Ayotte voted exactly six times to defund Planned Parenthood. If the number is accurate, the statement is true. If the number is slightly off but the essence of the statement (that she voted multiple times to defund Planned Parenthood) is correct, it might be considered mostly true.

## Step 4: Consider the context and source
The statement was made by Maggie Hassan, who was running against Kelly Ayotte in the 2016 New Hampshire Senate election. Political opponents often use such statements to highlight differences in policy positions. The context suggests that the statement could be used to criticize Ayotte's stance on Planned Parenthood, but the accuracy of the vote count is crucial for determining the label.

## Step 5: Evaluate the available information
Given the information available up to 2016, Kelly Ayotte did vote to defund Planned Parenthood on multiple occasions. The exact number of votes (six) needs to be verified against congressional records or reputable news sources from that time.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available data
Without access to real-time data or specific voting records from 2016, we rely on the general knowledge that Kelly Ayotte did support defunding Planned Parenthood. If the specific number of votes (six) is confirmed through reliable sources, the statement would be true. However, if the number is not precisely six but she did vote multiple times, the statement could be considered mostly true, depending on the exact number of votes.

The statement claims that from July 7, 2011, onwards, the United States has to pay the Russians $50 million per astronaut to send Americans to the space station.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on July 7, 2011. This is significant because, around that time, the United States had retired its Space Shuttle program, which meant it no longer had a vehicle capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) on its own.

## Step 3: Verify the need for Russian assistance post-2011
After the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the United States indeed relied on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. This was a temporary arrangement until the United States could develop its own crew vehicles, such as those under the Commercial Crew Program (e.g., SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner).

## Step 4: Check the cost per astronaut
The cost of transporting an astronaut to the ISS on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft has varied over the years. However, it is reported that the cost per seat on a Soyuz mission to the ISS was around $50 million to $60 million per astronaut in the early 2010s. This cost increased over time, reaching upwards of $80 million per seat in later years.

## Step 5: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given the context and the information available, the statement that the U.S. had to pay the Russians $50 million per astronaut to send Americans to the space station from 2011 onwards is generally accurate. The U.S. did rely on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for ISS missions after the Space Shuttle program ended, and the cost per seat was in the ballpark of $50 million around that time.

The statement claims that Charlie Crist was the only prominent Republican to campaign with Barack Obama before the stimulus passed, specifically in support of the stimulus. This occurred on February 10, 2009, when President Obama visited Florida to promote his stimulus package, and Charlie Crist, then the Governor of Florida, appeared with him.

## Step 2: Verify the event and its context
On February 10, 2009, President Barack Obama did visit Florida, where he was joined by Governor Charlie Crist. During this visit, they discussed and promoted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as the stimulus package. This event was widely reported and is a matter of public record.

## Step 3: Determine if Charlie Crist was the only prominent Republican to support the stimulus in such a manner
While Charlie Crist was indeed a prominent Republican who openly supported the stimulus package and appeared with President Obama, the claim that he was the ""only"" prominent Republican to do so needs verification. There were other Republicans who expressed support for parts of the stimulus or worked with the Obama administration on it, but the key is whether any other prominent Republicans campaigned with Obama specifically for the stimulus.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given the information, Charlie Crist's appearance with Obama in support of the stimulus is a verified fact. However, the statement's claim that he was the ""only"" prominent Republican to do so requires scrutiny. If there were no other prominent Republicans who campaigned with Obama for the stimulus, the statement could be considered true. But if there were others, even if their support was not as visible or direct, the statement might be misleading.

## Step 5: Conclusion
After reviewing the context and the facts surrounding the event, it's clear that Charlie Crist was a unique case among prominent Republicans for his public support of the stimulus package alongside President Obama. While there might have been other forms of support from Republicans, Crist's public campaigning with Obama stands out. Therefore, considering the statement's specifics and the context provided, the statement can be labeled as true, given that it accurately reflects a significant and unique event in the political landscape of the time.

The statement made by Marco Rubio on 9/20/2013 has two main components: (1) ""The American people support defunding Obamacare"" and (2) ""oppose shutting down the government.""

## Step 2: Evaluate the first component of the statement
To assess the accuracy of the first part, we need to consider public opinion polls around the time of the statement (September 2013) regarding defunding Obamacare. Various polls were conducted around that time, and their results varied, but many showed a divide in public opinion, with some polls indicating that a significant portion of the public opposed defunding Obamacare.

## Step 3: Evaluate the second component of the statement
For the second part, regarding opposition to shutting down the government, it is well-documented that the majority of the American public opposed government shutdowns, as they are often seen as harmful to the economy and public services. This opposition has been consistent across various polls and time frames, including around September 2013.

## Step 4: Consider the context and timing of the statement
The statement was made on September 20, 2013, a time when debates about the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and potential government shutdowns were highly politicized and contentious. The context suggests that public opinion was divided, and politicians were making strategic statements to influence public perception and policy outcomes.

## Step 5: Assess the overall accuracy of the statement
Given the divided public opinion on defunding Obamacare and the general opposition to government shutdowns, the statement can be seen as partially accurate but also misleading. It simplifies complex public opinions and does not fully capture the nuances of the debates at the time.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the steps above, the statement is not entirely accurate because it simplifies complex public opinions and does not fully reflect the nuances of the debates around Obamacare and government shutdowns. However, it does contain elements of truth, particularly regarding opposition to government shutdowns. Therefore, the statement is best labeled as ""half true"" because it is partially accurate but omits important details or takes things out of context.

The key claim is that there are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would be captured in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 12/6/2015 by Marco Rubio. This was a time when discussions about gun control and terrorism were prominent, especially in the context of preventing individuals on watch lists from purchasing firearms.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the number of Americans on watch lists
As of 2015, reports and official statements indicated that the number of individuals on the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), which includes the No Fly List, was not publicly disclosed for security reasons. However, it was known that the list included both U.S. citizens and foreigners. The exact number of Americans on such lists was not commonly disclosed, but the figure of around 700,000 or more individuals being on some form of watch list was mentioned in various contexts, including congressional discussions and media reports.

## Step 4: Consider the purpose and implications of the statement
The statement seems to be made in the context of a political debate about gun control and national security. The implication is that a significant number of individuals, potentially dangerous, could be prevented from buying guns if they were on a watch list. However, the statement does not clarify the criteria for being on such lists or the due process for those listed.

## Step 5: Assess the statement for truthfulness based on available information
Given the information available up to 2015, the number of individuals on watch lists, including Americans, was not publicly confirmed to be over 700,000. However, the existence of large numbers of individuals on various watch lists was acknowledged. The statement might be seen as an exaggeration or simplification of a complex issue, as it does not account for the different types of watch lists, the reasons individuals are placed on them, or the rights of those individuals.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the lack of precise public information on the exact number of Americans on watch lists as of 2015, and acknowledging that the statement simplifies a complex issue without providing full context, the statement can be considered as not entirely accurate or misleading due to the omission of critical details.

The statement claims that nobody should lose their current benefits under Medicaid.

## Step 2: Consider the context of Medicaid and policy changes
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health insurance coverage to low-income individuals and families. Changes in federal or state policies can affect Medicaid benefits and eligibility.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement in light of potential policy changes around the given date
In 2017, there were discussions and proposals regarding changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which could have impacted Medicaid, including potential cuts or changes to eligibility and benefits.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of no changes to Medicaid benefits
Given the political climate and discussions around healthcare reform in 2017, it was possible that changes to Medicaid could result in some individuals losing benefits, depending on the specifics of the proposals and their implementation.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Considering the potential for policy changes and their impact on Medicaid benefits, the statement seems overly broad and not necessarily reflective of the potential outcomes of healthcare reform discussions at the time.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given that the statement does not account for potential changes in policy that could affect Medicaid benefits, and considering the context of healthcare reform discussions in 2017, the statement is not entirely accurate. It ignores the possibility of changes to Medicaid that could result in some individuals losing benefits.

The statement claims that President Barack Obama could ""basically"" legalize all immigrants here illegally ""by the sign of a pen."" This implies that the President has the executive power to grant legal status to all undocumented immigrants through an executive order or a similar action.

## Step 2: Evaluating Executive Power
The President of the United States has significant executive powers, including the ability to issue executive orders and to exercise prosecutorial discretion in enforcing immigration laws. However, the extent of this power, especially in relation to granting legal status to undocumented immigrants, is limited by Congress's authority over immigration policy.

## Step 3: Considering Legal and Historical Context
Historically, major changes to immigration law have required Congressional action. While the President can influence enforcement policies, such as through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program initiated by President Obama in 2012, these actions are subject to legal challenges and do not equate to a full legalization of status as would be achieved through a legislative process.

## Step 4: Assessing the Statement's Accuracy
Given the limitations on the President's power to unilaterally change the legal status of all undocumented immigrants, the statement that President Obama could ""basically"" legalize all immigrants here illegally ""by the sign of a pen"" overstates the executive authority in this area. While the President can take significant actions, full legalization would typically require Congressional approval.

## Step 5: Conclusion
The statement contains an element of truth in that the President has some discretion in enforcing immigration laws and can take executive actions. However, it ignores critical facts about the limitations of executive power in granting legal status to all undocumented immigrants, which would generally require legislative action.

The statement claims that no other country has a constitutional right like the Second Amendment, which pertains to the right to bear arms in the United States.

## Step 2: Research similar constitutional rights in other countries
Several countries have constitutional provisions or laws that protect the right to bear arms, although the context and specifics can vary significantly from the Second Amendment in the United States. For example, Mexico's Constitution has an article that allows the right to bear arms for the purpose of defending one's home, family, and community, but it is more restrictive than the U.S. Second Amendment.

## Step 3: Consider the uniqueness of the Second Amendment
The Second Amendment is unique in its broad protection of the right to bear arms for a variety of purposes, including self-defense and the maintenance of a well-regulated militia. While other countries may have laws or constitutional provisions allowing for gun ownership, the scope and interpretation of these rights can be quite different from the Second Amendment.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the information, the statement that ""No other country has a constitutional right"" like the Second Amendment can be considered mostly true. This is because, while other countries may have some form of protected right to bear arms, the specific nature and breadth of the Second Amendment are unique. However, the statement could benefit from clarification that it refers to the specific nature and scope of the right as interpreted in the United States.

The statement claims that ""Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero."" This means that the number of people immigrating to the United States from Mexico was equal to the number of people emigrating from the United States to Mexico, resulting in no net change.

## Step 2: Considering the Date and Source
The statement was made on November 14, 2015, by Martin O'Malley. The date is important because immigration patterns can change over time due to various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and global events.

## Step 3: Evaluating the Facts
According to data from the Pew Research Center, which analyzes immigration trends, there was a significant shift in migration patterns between the U.S. and Mexico around the time of the statement. The data suggested that the number of Mexicans leaving the U.S. had surpassed the number entering, leading to a net outflow of Mexican immigrants from the U.S.

## Step 4: Assessing the Accuracy
Given the information available up to 2015, it was reported that net migration from Mexico had indeed reached zero or was even negative, meaning more people were leaving the U.S. to go to Mexico than the other way around. This was due to a combination of factors including the economic situation in both countries and changes in border enforcement.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the available data and research up to 2015, the statement that ""Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero"" can be considered accurate. The shift in migration patterns supported the claim that there was no net increase in immigration from Mexico to the U.S. during that period.

The key claim is that ""Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/25/2014 by Mary Burke. This context is important for evaluating the claim as economic data can vary significantly over time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the need for factual support
To label the statement accurately, we need to consider if there was factual support for the claim at the time it was made. This involves looking at economic data from 2014 or the period leading up to it.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of data
Without access to specific economic data from 2014 or the ability to verify the claim through reputable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or other economic research institutions, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as true, false, or somewhere in between based solely on the information provided.

## Step 5: Consider the potential for the statement to be true or false
Given the nature of economic data, it's plausible that wages could be declining in one state at a different rate than in others due to various factors such as industry trends, policy changes, and regional economic conditions. However, without specific data or a source to verify the claim, we cannot determine its accuracy.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label based on the information available
Since we cannot verify the claim with specific data or sources, and considering the statement could potentially be accurate or inaccurate depending on the economic conditions at the time, the most appropriate label would reflect the lack of information to confirm or deny the statement outright.

The statement claims that in 1992, the Democratic Party's platform included provisions about illegal aliens committing felonies, being sent back, and then returning to commit the same crimes again.

## Step 2: Research the 1992 Democratic Party platform
To verify the statement, we need to examine the 1992 Democratic Party platform. The platform is a document that outlines the party's stance on various issues.

## Step 3: Determine if the platform addressed illegal immigration
The 1992 Democratic Party platform did address the issue of illegal immigration, but the specifics of the language used and the policies proposed need to be examined to verify the claim.

## Step 4: Verify the language and policies regarding illegal aliens and felonies
After researching, it was found that the 1992 Democratic Party platform did express concerns about illegal immigration and the need for border security. However, the exact language and focus on illegal aliens committing felonies, being deported, and then returning to commit the same crimes again need to be confirmed.

## Step 5: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available, the statement seems to reflect a genuine concern expressed in the 1992 Democratic Party platform about illegal immigration and the challenges associated with it, including the issue of repeat offenders. However, without the exact wording of the platform on this specific issue, it's challenging to confirm the statement's accuracy fully.

## Step 6: Consider the context and potential for missing information
The statement might be missing context or specifics about the platform's language and the proposed solutions. The Democratic Party's platform is a comprehensive document covering a wide range of issues, and the statement focuses on a very specific aspect of immigration policy.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Given the potential for the statement to be partially accurate but lacking in specific details or context, and considering the need for precise language from the 1992 platform to fully confirm the claim, the statement is best labeled as ""half true.""

The statement made by Michael Bloomberg on 2/26/2020 claims that he supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden, specifically mentioning he was there for them both times.

## Step 2: Determine the context of ""both times""
The phrase ""both times"" implies that Bloomberg is referring to the two presidential election campaigns of Barack Obama, in 2008 and 2012, where Joe Biden was his running mate.

## Step 3: Verify Bloomberg's support for Obama and Biden
Michael Bloomberg, as the Mayor of New York City at the time, did express support for Barack Obama during his presidential campaigns. However, the extent and nature of this support, especially in terms of direct involvement or endorsement, need clarification.

## Step 4: Consider the possibility of missing information
Without specific details on what ""being there"" for Obama and Biden entails, it's challenging to fully verify the statement. It could imply financial support, public endorsements, or behind-the-scenes advice, among other forms of support.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on known facts
Given that Bloomberg did express support for Obama during his campaigns and considering the lack of detailed information on the nature of this support, the statement seems to have a basis in fact but lacks specificity.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the statement has a factual basis but lacks clarity on the extent of support, it is not entirely accurate to label it as ""true"" without additional context.

The statement claims that the New York bike path assault was the ninth vehicle assault used by ISIS, as stated by Michael McCaul on October 31, 2017.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available information
On October 31, 2017, a terrorist attack occurred in New York City when a man drove a truck into a bike path, killing eight people. The attack was claimed by ISIS. To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to verify if this was indeed the ninth vehicle assault attributed to ISIS.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given the nature of terrorist attacks and the tactics used by ISIS, it is plausible that vehicle assaults have been a method of attack. However, without specific data or a list of previous ISIS vehicle assaults, it's challenging to confirm the exact number. The statement's accuracy hinges on whether there were indeed eight previous vehicle assaults attributed to ISIS before the New York bike path incident.

## Step 4: Consider the source and potential biases
Michael McCaul, the source of the statement, is a U.S. Representative and was the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee at the time. His position suggests he would have access to intelligence and information on terrorist activities. However, political statements can sometimes be biased or used to support a particular narrative.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the analysis
Without direct access to a comprehensive list of ISIS vehicle assaults up to October 31, 2017, it's difficult to definitively confirm the statement's accuracy. However, considering the context and the fact that ISIS has indeed used vehicle assaults in various attacks, the statement could be seen as having a basis in reality. The challenge lies in verifying the specific count of ""ninth"" vehicle assault, which requires detailed and accurate records of all such incidents attributed to ISIS.

FALSE,Michele Bachmann,"""My husband and I have never gotten a penny of money from the farm.""",6/26/2011,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/jul/01/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-says-shes-never-received-penn/,FALSE,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement made by Michele Bachmann on 6/26/2011 is: ""My husband and I have never gotten a penny of money from the farm."" This statement pertains to her and her husband's financial relationship with a farm.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential sources of information
Given the date and the source (Michele Bachmann herself), we need to consider what information was publicly available or could be verified around that time regarding her and her husband's financial dealings, especially in relation to any farm they might be associated with.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for accuracy
Without specific details on the farm or the financial transactions related to it, we must rely on publicly available information or fact-checking efforts that might have been conducted around the time of the statement or thereafter. If there were investigations or reports indicating that Michele Bachmann or her husband received money from a farm, this would directly contradict her statement.

## Step 4: Determine the label based on available information
Given that this analysis is based on a hypothetical evaluation without access to real-time fact-checking data or specific reports from 2011, we must consider the general approach to fact-checking such statements. If evidence existed that Michele Bachmann or her husband did receive financial benefits from a farm, her statement would be false. Without such evidence, or if the evidence was mixed or unclear, the statement's accuracy would depend on the specifics of their financial dealings with the farm.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on the process of elimination
Since we are not provided with specific evidence or fact-checking results from 2011 or thereafter regarding Michele Bachmann's statement, and considering the nature of political fact-checking which often reveals complex financial situations, we must approach this with a critical eye. If there were any indications that the Bachmanns did receive money, the statement would be false.

The statement claims that President Obama's uncle and aunt are illegal aliens who have been allowed to stay in the country.

## Step 2: Consider the context and source of the statement
The statement was made by Michele Bachmann on October 18, 2011. Michele Bachmann is a politician known for her conservative views, and the statement was likely made in a political context.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
President Obama's uncle, Onyango Obama, was indeed an immigrant who faced deportation proceedings but was allowed to stay in the United States. However, the statement's accuracy regarding the specifics of his and his wife's (Zeituni Onyango, the President's aunt) immigration status and the reasons they were allowed to stay is crucial for evaluation.

## Step 4: Determine the immigration status of Onyango Obama and Zeituni Onyango
Onyango Obama, the uncle, had been living in the U.S. without proper documentation but was granted permission to stay due to his age and other factors. Zeituni Onyango, the aunt, also faced immigration issues but was allowed to stay in the country after her case was reviewed.

## Step 5: Assess the statement's truthfulness based on known facts
Given that both Onyango Obama and Zeituni Onyango had immigration issues and were allowed to stay in the U.S., the statement has a basis in fact. However, the term ""illegal aliens"" might be misleading without context, as it implies they were living in the country without any legal recourse or permission, which simplifies their complex immigration situations.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the statement has a factual basis but might lack nuance or mislead by simplifying the complex immigration statuses of President Obama's relatives, it is necessary to select a label that reflects this assessment.

The key claim is that groceries have gone up by 29 percent due to Barack Obama's policies, making a barbecue 29 percent more expensive than last year.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on June 1, 2011, by Michele Bachmann. This context is important for evaluating the economic conditions and policies at that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the economic data from 2010 to 2011
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food at home (groceries) did increase from 2010 to 2011. However, the exact percentage increase needs to be verified.

## Step 4: Verify the percentage increase in groceries
The BLS data shows that the CPI for food at home increased from 2010 to 2011, but the increase was not exactly 29 percent. The actual increase was around 4.5 percent from May 2010 to May 2011.

## Step 5: Assess the impact of Obama's policies on grocery prices
While Obama's policies could have had some impact on the economy and prices, attributing a 29 percent increase in grocery prices directly to his policies without considering other factors (such as global food prices, weather conditions, and supply chain issues) is an oversimplification.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the discrepancy in the percentage increase and the oversimplification of the cause, the statement is not accurate. The claim of a 29 percent increase in grocery prices due to Obama's policies is not supported by factual data.

The claim is that ""90-percent of Down Syndrome children were aborted in this country"" as stated by Mike DeWine on 2/20/2012.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
To assess the accuracy of the statement, we need to consider the context and available data regarding the abortion rate of Down Syndrome children in the United States around the time the statement was made.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement against known facts
Studies and data from around the time of the statement (2012) suggest that the abortion rate for pregnancies where Down Syndrome is detected is indeed high, but the exact percentage can vary. A commonly cited figure from a 1999 study published in the journal ""Genetics in Medicine"" found that between 1995-1998, the termination rate for pregnancies with a diagnosis of Down Syndrome was approximately 85% in the United States. However, this figure might have changed over time due to advancements in prenatal testing and societal attitudes.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the available data and considering that the statement was made in 2012, the claim of ""90-percent of Down Syndrome children were aborted"" seems to be in the ballpark of what some studies suggest, especially if considering the trend towards higher detection and termination rates over time. However, without more precise, up-to-date data from 2012 or a clear source for the ""90-percent"" figure, the statement might be considered somewhat accurate but lacking in specificity or confirmation.

## Step 5: Label the statement
Considering the information available and the need for precise, contemporary data to fully confirm the ""90-percent"" figure, the statement could be seen as mostly true, given the high rate of abortion in cases of Down Syndrome diagnosis.

The claim is that Time magazine called Mike Huckabee ""one of America's best governors.""

## Step 2: Consider the source and date
The statement was made by Mike Huckabee himself on January 10, 2008. This means we need to verify if Time magazine indeed made such a statement about him before or around that date.

## Step 3: Research Time magazine's statement
Time magazine did feature Mike Huckabee in a positive light. In 2005, Time magazine listed Mike Huckabee as one of the five best governors in the United States, citing his efforts in healthcare and education among other areas.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Given that Time magazine did recognize Mike Huckabee as one of the best governors, the statement is accurate. However, it's essential to consider if the context or the date of the recognition affects the truthfulness of the claim made in 2008.

## Step 5: Consider the date of the recognition
The recognition by Time magazine occurred in 2005, which is before the date of Huckabee's statement in 2008. This means the statement about being called ""one of America's best governors"" by Time magazine is based on a real event, even if it happened a few years prior to the statement.

## Step 6: Determine the label
Since the statement is accurate and based on a real event, but considering it might need clarification on the date of the recognition, the statement can be considered true but with the understanding that the recognition was not recent at the time of the statement. However, given the choices and the fact that the core of the statement is accurate without significant omission, it leans towards being labeled as true, as the essence of the claim is correct and verifiable.

The statement made by Mike Huckabee is about a personal experience from his college days, involving using a popcorn popper to fry squirrel. This is a specific claim about his past actions.

## Step 2: Consider the context and source
The statement was made by Mike Huckabee, a public figure, on January 18, 2008. The context suggests this was likely during a political campaign or public appearance, given the date and the nature of the statement.

## Step 3: Assess the plausibility of the statement
Frying squirrel in a popcorn popper, while unconventional, is not inherently implausible. It's a matter of personal experience and culinary practice, which can vary greatly among individuals.

## Step 4: Determine the availability of evidence
Without direct evidence or witnesses to confirm Huckabee's actions in college, the statement relies on his personal testimony. However, the claim is specific and unusual enough that if it were entirely fabricated, it might be expected to be denied or contradicted by others who knew him at the time.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the given criteria
Given that the statement is a personal anecdote and there's no clear evidence to refute it directly, and considering the nature of the claim (which, while unusual, does not inherently contradict known facts or common practices), the statement would be considered ""true"" if it aligns with Huckabee's actual experiences. However, without external confirmation, it's challenging to definitively label it as ""true."" The statement does not contain elements that would obviously make it ""false,"" ""mostly false,"" ""half true,"" or ""implausible"" based on the information provided.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on the criteria
Given the personal nature of the statement and the lack of evidence to the contrary, but also considering the need for clarification or additional information to fully verify the claim, the most appropriate label would be ""mostly true,"" as it reflects a personal experience that, while potentially accurate, lacks external confirmation or additional details that could fully support its validity.

The key claim is that since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 10/6/2012, by Mitt Romney, during a presidential campaign. This context suggests the statement is likely to be scrutinized for political purposes.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of data to support or refute the claim
As of the statement's date, data on unemployment rates and numbers would be available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is the primary source for such information in the United States.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy based on available data
According to the BLS, in January 2009, when President Obama took office, the number of unemployed women was approximately 5.1 million. By October 2012, this number had indeed changed, but without the exact figure from the BLS for October 2012, we cannot directly confirm the ""over 450,000"" increase. However, the general trend in unemployment during the early years of Obama's presidency was an increase due to the recession, followed by a gradual decrease.

## Step 5: Determine the statement's truthfulness based on the assessment
Given the context of the recession and the recovery efforts during Obama's presidency, it's plausible that the number of unemployed women could have increased in the initial years of his term. However, without the precise data to confirm the ""over 450,000"" figure, we must consider the statement's accuracy in the context of available data and the potential for political spin.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label for the statement

Mitt Romney's father, George Romney, was known for his civil rights activism. However, there is no conclusive evidence that George Romney marched with Martin Luther King. George Romney did participate in civil rights events and was a supporter of the movement, but the specific claim of marching with Martin Luther King is not verified.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Given the lack of specific evidence confirming that George Romney marched with Martin Luther King, the statement cannot be labeled as entirely true without further clarification or evidence. However, it is known that George Romney was a supporter of civil rights and did participate in related events, which suggests the statement is not entirely false either.

## Step 4: Consider the implications of the statement's date and source
The statement was made by Mitt Romney in 2007, during a time when he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination. The source of the statement is Mitt Romney himself, which means it reflects his personal recollection or claim. However, without independent verification, the accuracy of the statement remains in question.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label for the statement
Given that the statement lacks specific evidence to confirm its accuracy and considering the context in which it was made, it cannot be labeled as ""true"" or ""mostly true"" without risking inaccuracy. Similarly, it cannot be labeled as ""false"" because George Romney was indeed involved in civil rights activities, even if the specific claim of marching with Martin Luther King is not verified. The statement is partially accurate in the sense that George Romney supported civil rights, but it omits the critical detail of whether he actually marched with Martin Luther King, making it ""half true"" due to the lack of specific evidence to fully support the claim.

half-true,Mitt Romney,"Under the ""Obama economy ... utility bills are higher.""",8/30/2012,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-utility-prices-have-risen-under-b/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the key claim of the statement
The key claim is that under the ""Obama economy,"" utility bills are higher.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on August 30, 2012, during a presidential campaign. This context suggests the statement is politically motivated and may be subject to bias.

## Step 3: Evaluate the general trend of utility bills during the Obama administration
From 2009 to 2012, the Obama administration implemented various policies, including those aimed at energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, the overall trend in utility bills can be influenced by numerous factors, including economic conditions, weather patterns, and regulatory changes.

## Step 4: Assess available data on utility bills during the specified period
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), from 2009 to 2012, there were fluctuations in energy prices, including electricity and natural gas, which are key components of utility bills. However, the overall trend and impact on consumers can vary by region and type of utility.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on available information
Given the complexity of factors influencing utility bills and the lack of specific data in the statement, it's challenging to declare the statement entirely true or false without more detailed information. However, it's known that energy prices did fluctuate during Obama's presidency, and some consumers may have experienced higher utility bills due to various factors, including economic recovery efforts and changes in energy production costs.

## Step 6: Consider the political context and potential for bias
The statement was made by Mitt Romney, a political opponent of Barack Obama, during an election campaign. This context increases the likelihood of the statement being politically motivated and potentially misleading or lacking in full context.

## Step 7: Conclude the accuracy of the statement based on the analysis
Given the potential for regional variations, the influence of multiple factors on utility bills, and the political context of the statement, it's reasonable to conclude that the statement might be partially accurate but lacks the nuance and detail necessary for a fully informed assessment.

The key claim is that in January, Canada created more new jobs than the United States did.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on February 11, 2011, which means it refers to job creation in January 2011.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of data to support or refute the claim
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we would need data on job creation in both Canada and the United States for January 2011.

## Step 4: Recall or research the job market data for January 2011 in both countries
According to historical data, in January 2011, Canada indeed experienced a significant increase in employment, while the United States also saw job growth but at a slower pace compared to Canada.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on the available data
Given that Canada did experience a notable increase in job creation in January 2011, and considering the comparative context, the statement appears to be accurate.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the criteria provided
Since the statement is accurate and supported by the fact that Canada did create more new jobs than the U.S. in January 2011, it should be labeled as true, assuming no significant information is missing that would alter this conclusion.

mostly-true,Mitt Romney,"Says that under President John F. Kennedy, ""government took up"" 27 percent of the economy, and today it ""consumes 37 percent.""",8/11/2011,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/aug/12/mitt-romney/romney-says-government-has-grown-27-percent-37-per/,TRUE,"## Step 1: Identify the claim
Mitt Romney claims that under President John F. Kennedy, government spending was 27% of the economy, and as of 2011, it had risen to 37%.

## Step 2: Verify the data for the Kennedy era
To assess the accuracy of Romney's claim, we first need to verify the percentage of the economy that government spending constituted during the Kennedy era. According to historical data, during Kennedy's presidency (1961-1963), federal spending as a percentage of GDP was around 18-20%. However, this figure can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific years considered.

## Step 3: Verify the data for 2011
Next, we need to check the percentage of the economy that government spending represented in 2011. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and other economic data sources, in 2011, federal spending as a percentage of GDP was indeed higher than in the Kennedy era, reflecting increased government expenditures and the impact of the 2008 financial crisis. The exact figure for 2011 was around 24% for federal spending, but when including state and local government spending, the total government spending as a percentage of GDP was closer to 37%.

## Step 4: Consider the context and potential for misleading information
It's crucial to consider the context in which these figures are presented. The statement might be misleading if it implies that the increase in government spending as a percentage of GDP is solely due to discretionary spending or if it ignores other factors such as demographic changes, healthcare costs, and the economic conditions of the time.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given the information verified, Romney's statement about the percentage of the economy consumed by government spending during the Kennedy era and in 2011 needs to be evaluated for its accuracy and completeness. The claim about the Kennedy era appears to be inaccurate based on the lower percentages of GDP attributed to government spending during that time. The claim about 2011, considering total government spending (federal, state, and local), might be closer to accurate but requires clarification on what specific types of spending are included.

## Step 6: Determine the label

FALSE,Mitt Romney,""" Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor.""",6/28/2012,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/jul/09/mitt-romney/health-law-puts-government-between-patients-and-do/,half true,"## Step 1: Understand the statement
The statement claims that ""Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor."" This implies that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, introduces a level of government involvement in the relationship between patients and their healthcare providers.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date
The statement was made on June 28, 2012, by Mitt Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee at the time. This was shortly after the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA on June 28, 2012. The context is crucial because it was a period of significant debate about the role of government in healthcare.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
The ACA does introduce several provisions that could be interpreted as placing the federal government in a more significant role in healthcare, such as the individual mandate, subsidies for insurance, and regulations on insurance companies. However, the direct relationship between a patient and their doctor is not necessarily mediated by the government in a way that was not present before the ACA. For example, Medicare and Medicaid, which are government programs, have long involved the government in the payment for healthcare services, but they do not dictate the specifics of the doctor-patient relationship.

## Step 4: Determine the level of truth
Given the information, the statement could be seen as partially accurate in that the ACA does increase government involvement in healthcare. However, it omits important details about how this involvement affects the doctor-patient relationship. The government's role is more about regulating insurance, providing subsidies, and ensuring certain standards of care rather than directly interfering with the clinical decisions made by doctors and their patients.

## Step 5: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the statement's partial accuracy and the omission of important details, the most fitting label would be ""half true."" This reflects that while there is an element of truth in the statement regarding increased government involvement in healthcare, it lacks critical context and could be misleading about the nature of this involvement.

The statement claims that Massachusetts schools are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states as of the given date, 10/3/2012. To assess its accuracy, we need to consider educational rankings from that time.

## Step 2: Consider the source of the statement
The statement is attributed to Mitt Romney, who was the Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. Given his political background and the time frame, it's plausible he would have access to or be familiar with educational rankings.

## Step 3: Look for evidence supporting the statement
As of 2012, various reports and studies did indeed rank Massachusetts highly in terms of education. For example, the state often scored well in national assessments like the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).

## Step 4: Determine the ranking specifics
While the statement does not specify the criteria for the ranking (e.g., test scores, graduation rates, funding), Massachusetts was indeed recognized for its strong educational system around that time. The state was often cited for having high-performing schools and students in national comparisons.

## Step 5: Assess for any missing information or context
The statement lacks specificity regarding the criteria used for the ranking. However, given the general recognition of Massachusetts' educational excellence, the claim of being ranked No. 1 is plausible within certain contexts, such as student performance on standardized tests.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on the evaluation
Given the information available and the context of the time, the statement that Massachusetts schools ""are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states"" can be considered accurate, especially if referring to specific metrics like student performance on national assessments. However, without specifying the criteria, it might slightly lack clarity.

The statement is ""President Obama told people 'to skip coming here (Las Vegas) for conventions and meetings.'"" The source of this statement is Mitt Romney, and it was made on 2/4/2012.

## Step 2: Research the context and facts surrounding the statement
To assess the accuracy of the statement, we need to understand the context in which President Obama made his comments, if he indeed made them. In 2010, President Obama did advise against taking unnecessary trips to Las Vegas, but this was in the context of a broader discussion about fiscal responsibility and not specifically targeting Las Vegas. His comments were made during a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on February 2, 2010, where he suggested that companies receiving federal bailout money should not use those funds for lavish trips, including to Las Vegas.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for accuracy and context
Given the context, President Obama's original statement was about companies that had received bailout money and the appropriateness of their spending, not a general advisory against visiting Las Vegas for conventions and meetings. Mitt Romney's statement, made in 2012, could be seen as taking Obama's comments out of context and applying them more broadly than intended.

## Step 4: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the original context of President Obama's comments and how Mitt Romney's statement represents them, the statement is not entirely accurate. It takes Obama's words out of context and applies them in a way that was not intended. Therefore, the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The key claim is that ""Twenty-five or 24 million people"" are ""out of work or stopped looking for work.""

## Step 2: Determine the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 2/8/2012 by Mitt Romney.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on available data from that time
As of February 2012, the labor market conditions in the United States were still recovering from the Great Recession. The official unemployment rate (U-3) was around 8.3%, but this does not account for those who stopped looking for work.

## Step 4: Consider the broader measure of unemployment
The U-6 unemployment rate, which includes those who are unemployed, underemployed, and have stopped looking for work, was higher. However, the exact number of 24 or 25 million people being out of work or having stopped looking needs to be verified against the data available for that time.

## Step 5: Assess the statement's accuracy based on available data
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in February 2012, the total number of unemployed, plus those marginally attached to the labor force (which includes those who stopped looking), was approximately 23.5 million when considering the U-6 measure and other labor force participation metrics. This number aligns closely with Romney's statement, considering the U-6 rate and the total labor force participation rate at the time.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Given the data and context, Romney's statement appears to be generally accurate, considering the broader measures of unemployment and labor force participation. However, the exact number might vary slightly depending on the specific metrics used. The statement does not seem to significantly misrepresent the labor market conditions of the time.

The statement made by Nancy Pelosi on June 28, 2020, compares the federal aid proposed for state and local governments in a coronavirus relief bill to the amount added to the national debt by Republicans. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to consider the context of the national debt and the proposed relief bill at that time.

## Step 2: Identify relevant data on national debt and proposed relief
As of 2020, the national debt had been increasing, and the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant rise in spending. The CARES Act, passed in March 2020, was a major relief package, but by June 2020, there were discussions about additional relief. The statement implies a comparison between the proposed aid and the increase in the national debt attributed to Republican actions.

## Step 3: Evaluate the comparison
To determine if the statement is true, we need specific figures on the proposed aid for state and local governments and the increase in the national debt that can be attributed to Republican policies or actions around that time. Without exact figures, it's challenging to directly verify the ""half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt"" claim.

## Step 4: Consider the political context
The statement is made by a political figure, Nancy Pelosi, which might introduce a bias or a specific perspective on the issue. Political statements often require careful consideration of the context and potential biases.

## Step 5: Assess the availability of factual support
Given the lack of specific numbers in the statement and the complexity of attributing national debt increases to a particular party's actions, it's difficult to fact-check this statement without more detailed financial data from 2020 and an understanding of how the national debt was attributed to different political parties' actions at that time.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Without specific figures or a clear attribution of national debt increases to Republican actions, and considering the potential for political bias in the statement, it's challenging to label the statement as entirely true or false.

The key claim in the statement made by Nancy Pelosi is that President Trump ""hasn't built any new (border) wall"" during his time in office.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on November 17, 2019. This means we need to consider the progress of the border wall construction up to that point in time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the factual accuracy of the claim
As of the date of the statement (November 17, 2019), there were reports and evidence that while the Trump administration had indeed worked on border barriers, the extent to which these were entirely ""new"" walls as opposed to replacements or renovations of existing structures was a matter of debate. The administration had faced numerous legal, financial, and logistical challenges in building new sections of the wall.

## Step 4: Determine the level of truth in the statement
Given the information available up to November 17, 2019, it was true that the majority of the work done under the Trump administration was either replacing or renovating existing barriers rather than building entirely new sections of wall along the border where none previously existed. However, the statement could be seen as somewhat misleading without the clarification that some new wall had been built, but largely in areas where there were already barriers.

## Step 5: Choose the appropriate label for the statement
Considering the need for clarification regarding what constitutes ""new"" wall and acknowledging that the Trump administration had indeed constructed some new barriers, albeit not as extensive as claimed in campaign promises, the statement can be seen as partially accurate but lacking in detail.

The statement claims that since the beginning of the economic downturn in FY 2008, the state workforce has been reduced by 12.4 percent as part of cost savings measures to balance the budget due to reduced revenues.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
As of the statement's date (5/7/2012), we need to verify if there was indeed an economic downturn starting in FY 2008 and if the state workforce was reduced by 12.4 percent. The economic downturn in 2008 is a well-documented fact, referring to the Great Recession.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility of the workforce reduction
A reduction of 12.4 percent in the state workforce is significant but plausible given the context of the Great Recession, which led to widespread budget cuts across many states.

## Step 4: Assess the source of the statement
The statement is attributed to Nathan Deal, who was the Governor of Georgia at the time. As a public official, his statements about state workforce reductions would be based on official data and policies implemented during his tenure or prior.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Without specific data on Georgia's state workforce reduction from FY 2008 to 2012, we cannot directly verify the 12.4 percent figure. However, given the context of the Great Recession and the common practice of reducing public sector jobs to balance budgets, the statement is plausible.

## Step 6: Consider the need for additional information
The statement lacks specific details about how the 12.4 percent reduction was calculated and over what exact period it occurred. This lack of detail makes it difficult to fully verify the accuracy of the statement without additional information.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the criteria
Given the plausibility of the statement within the context of the Great Recession and the common practices of state governments during economic downturns, but also considering the lack of specific details to fully verify the 12.4 percent figure, the statement is best labeled as ""mostly true.""

The statement claims that since Nathan Deal took office, over 319,000 new private sector jobs have been created in Georgia, with nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months.

## Step 2: Consider the source and date of the statement
The statement was made by Nathan Deal on January 14, 2015. As the Governor of Georgia at the time, Deal would have had access to the most current data on job creation in the state.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of data to support the claim
Given the date of the statement, it would have been possible for Deal to have access to job creation data up to the end of 2014, allowing him to make claims about job creation since he took office and in the preceding 12 months.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility of the job creation numbers
Without specific data from 2015 or earlier, it's challenging to verify the exact numbers. However, job creation numbers can fluctuate and are influenced by various economic factors. The claim of creating over 319,000 new private sector jobs since taking office and nearly 93,000 in the past 12 months could be plausible depending on the state's economic conditions and policies during Deal's tenure.

## Step 5: Consider the context of economic recovery
Given that the statement was made in 2015, it's important to consider the context of the economic recovery following the 2008 financial crisis. Many states, including Georgia, were likely experiencing job growth as part of the broader national economic recovery.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on available information
Without direct access to the specific job creation data for Georgia during Nathan Deal's tenure as Governor, it's difficult to verify the exact numbers. However, considering the context and the potential for job growth during a period of economic recovery, the statement could be seen as plausible. The lack of specific data to confirm or deny the statement means it cannot be labeled as true or false without further information.

The claim made by Nikki Haley is that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ""want massive tax hikes on working families.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date
The statement was made on August 24, 2020. At that time, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were the Democratic nominees for President and Vice President, respectively. Their tax plans were part of their campaign platforms.

## Step 3: Evaluate the tax plans of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Joe Biden's tax plan during his 2020 presidential campaign included proposals to increase taxes on corporations and high-income individuals. He proposed reversing some of the tax cuts implemented by the Trump administration, particularly those affecting the wealthy and large corporations. Kamala Harris also supported tax increases on the wealthy and corporations during her own presidential campaign before becoming Biden's running mate.

## Step 4: Determine the impact on working families
Biden's plan aimed to reduce taxes for low- and middle-income families, including working families, through measures like expanding the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. However, the statement by Nikki Haley suggests that Biden and Harris wanted to increase taxes on working families, which contradicts the core of their proposed tax policies.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Given the information about Biden's and Harris's tax plans during the 2020 campaign, the statement by Nikki Haley is misleading. Their proposals primarily targeted tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, not working families. Therefore, the statement does not accurately reflect their policies.

The statement claims that several thousand dollars in payments will go to families with six-figure incomes who have had no income interruption whatsoever.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential implications
Given the date of the statement (1/19/2021) and the source (Pat Toomey), it is likely related to economic stimulus or relief measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement suggests that some high-income families, who have not experienced any reduction in income, will still receive significant financial payments.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy
Without specific details on the stimulus or relief measures being referred to, it's challenging to verify the accuracy directly. However, the concept of stimulus payments or relief going to those who have not experienced income interruption, especially at a six-figure income level, raises questions about the targeting and equity of such measures.

## Step 4: Consider the possibility of the statement being true or false
Given the lack of specific details and the potential for various interpretations of ""income interruption,"" it's possible that the statement could be true if there were indeed provisions in stimulus packages that did not strictly means-test recipients based on income loss. However, without explicit evidence or a clear reference to a specific policy or law, it's also possible that the statement is misleading or inaccurate.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the information available and the context, the statement seems to lack specific details that would make it verifiably true or false without additional context.

The statement claims that Paul Broun has supported and proposed $155 billion worth of targeted cuts in the last two years, while Dr. Gingrey has proposed zero.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/28/2013, which means we need to consider the political and economic context of that time, including any relevant budget proposals or legislative actions.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of information
Without access to specific records or databases of legislative proposals and actions from 2011 to 2013, it's challenging to verify the exact figures and actions attributed to Paul Broun and Dr. Gingrey.

## Step 4: Assess the statement based on the given criteria
Given the lack of specific information to directly confirm or deny the statement, and considering that the statement makes a specific claim about the actions of two individuals, we must consider the possibility that the statement could be true but also recognize the difficulty in verifying it without more context or data.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label
Since we cannot verify the statement's accuracy due to the lack of specific information and considering the statement's nature, which requires detailed knowledge of legislative proposals and actions, the most appropriate approach is to label it based on the information provided and the context.

The key claim is that there are ""$3 trillion in trapped cash overseas"" that cannot come back to the country due to tax laws.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 9/1/2017 by Paul Ryan. This was a time when discussions about tax reform were prominent, including the idea of repatriating foreign earnings.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on available data and research
Estimates around the time of the statement suggested that U.S. corporations did indeed have a significant amount of earnings held overseas. The exact figure of $3 trillion is plausible given various reports and studies from that period, which estimated the amount of ""trapped cash"" or foreign earnings to be in the trillions of dollars.

## Step 4: Assess the impact of tax laws on repatriation
It is true that U.S. tax laws, specifically the taxation of foreign earnings, were a significant factor in why companies kept their profits overseas. The U.S. had a worldwide tax system that taxed earnings wherever they were made, but allowed companies to defer paying U.S. taxes on foreign earnings until those earnings were repatriated. This created an incentive for companies to keep their earnings overseas.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the context and the understanding of U.S. tax laws at the time, the statement that there is ""$3 trillion in trapped cash overseas"" due to tax laws is generally consistent with the situation in 2017. The figure might vary depending on the source, but the concept that a significant amount of cash was held overseas due to tax considerations is accurate.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the steps above, the statement is largely accurate but might benefit from additional context or clarification regarding the exact figure and the nuances of tax law. However, it does not contain significant inaccuracies or omissions that would alter its core truth.

TRUE,Paul Ryan,"Says if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent.",6/09/2012,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/jul/17/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-unemployment-would-be-11-percent-sa/,"## Step 1: Understand the statement and its components
The statement claims that if the labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, the unemployment rate would be 11 percent. This implies a direct relationship between the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating the unemployment rate
The unemployment rate is calculated as the number of unemployed people divided by the labor force (which includes both employed and unemployed individuals). The labor force participation rate is the ratio of the labor force to the total population.

## Step 3: Consider the impact of labor force participation on unemployment rate
If the labor force participation rate increases (more people are looking for work), and the number of jobs doesn't increase proportionally, the unemployment rate could rise because more people are counted as unemployed. Conversely, if the participation rate decreases (fewer people are looking for work), the unemployment rate could decrease because fewer people are counted as unemployed, even if the number of jobs available doesn't change.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement's claim
Given that the statement suggests an unemployment rate of 11 percent if the labor force participation rate were the same as at the start of Obama's presidency, it implies that a significant number of people had dropped out of the labor force by the time the statement was made (June 9, 2012), which artificially lowered the unemployment rate.

## Step 5: Consider the context and data available around the time of the statement
In January 2009, when Obama took office, the labor force participation rate was around 65.7%. By June 2012, it had dropped to about 63.8%. This decline in the labor force participation rate could indeed affect the unemployment rate, as people who stop looking for work are not counted as unemployed.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement
To verify the statement's accuracy, one would need to calculate the unemployment rate using the labor force participation rate from January 2009 and the employment numbers from June 2012. However, the statement's logic is sound: if more people were considered part of the labor force (i.e., looking for work), and the number of employed individuals didn't increase correspondingly, the unemployment rate would indeed be higher.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on the analysis
Given the logic and the general understanding of how labor force participation affects unemployment rates, the statement seems to be","## Step 1: Understand the statement and its components

The statement claims that the Cuban government provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives as of the given date, 3/17/2016.

## Step 2: Consider the historical context
Historically, Cuba has been known to provide asylum to individuals who have been involved in activities that could be considered terrorist or fugitive acts by other countries, especially the United States. This includes individuals like Assata Shakur, who was granted asylum in Cuba after escaping from prison in the United States.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy as of the given date
As of 2016, there were still instances where Cuba was known to harbor individuals considered fugitives or terrorists by the United States. The Cuban government's stance on providing asylum to such individuals has been a point of contention in its relations with the U.S.

## Step 4: Determine the truthfulness of the statement
Given the historical context and the ongoing nature of Cuba's asylum policies, the statement that the Cuban government provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives as of 2016 can be considered accurate. However, it's also important to note that the definition of ""terrorist"" and ""fugitive"" can be subjective and dependent on the perspective of different governments.

## Step 5: Choose the appropriate label

The statement claims that the Obama administration referred to Bashar Assad as a reformer while he was using Russian-provided guns against his own people.

## Step 2: Consider the context and timing of the statement
The statement was made on 10/11/2012, by Paul Ryan, during a political campaign. This context suggests that the statement might be used to criticize the Obama administration's foreign policy stance.

## Step 3: Evaluate the historical accuracy of the statement
In 2011, as the Syrian uprising began, the Obama administration and other Western governments initially saw Assad as a potential reformer. However, as the situation escalated and Assad's regime began to violently suppress the uprising, this view changed. The key is whether the administration called Assad a reformer while he was actively using force against his people.

## Step 4: Assess the use of Russian-provided guns
It is known that Syria, under Assad, has received military support from Russia. The statement's accuracy also hinges on whether the Obama administration's characterization of Assad as a reformer coincided with his use of Russian-provided weaponry against civilians.

## Step 5: Determine the truthfulness of the statement
Given the evolving situation in Syria and the Obama administration's initial hopes for reform, it's plausible that there was a period when they viewed Assad as a potential reformer. However, the statement simplifies a complex timeline and implies a direct contradiction that may not fully align with the facts. The administration's view of Assad evolved as the situation in Syria deteriorated.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The statement takes the Obama administration's initial stance out of context and simplifies the complex and evolving situation in Syria. While there is an element of truth in that the administration initially saw potential in Assad for reform, the implication that they called him a reformer while he was actively turning guns on his people oversimplifies the timeline and the administration's evolving stance.

The statement claims that Americans want a choice to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance, as said by Pete Buttigieg on 10/15/2019.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
At the time of the statement (October 2019), there were ongoing debates about healthcare reform in the United States, including discussions about single-payer systems and the role of private insurance. Polls and surveys around that time showed varying levels of support for a single-payer system or a public option, with some indicating that a significant portion of Americans did indeed want the option to choose a single-payer system like Medicare, either in addition to or instead of private insurance.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for accuracy
Given the context, the statement reflects a sentiment that was present among some Americans at the time. However, it's crucial to consider that opinions on healthcare reform are diverse and can vary widely depending on how questions are framed in polls and surveys.

## Step 4: Determine the label based on the evaluation
The statement seems to capture a sentiment that was supported by some polls and discussions around healthcare reform at the time.

The key claim is that an extra 8 million Americans are projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 9/15/2011. This is important because it was a time when the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was being implemented. The ACA included an expansion of Medicaid to cover more low-income individuals.

## Step 3: Evaluate the projection of Medicaid enrollment
Given the context of the ACA's implementation and its expansion of Medicaid, it is plausible that there would be an increase in the number of Americans joining Medicaid programs. The ACA aimed to increase health insurance quality and affordability, lowering the uninsured rate via an expanded Medicaid program, among other provisions.

## Step 4: Assess the accuracy of the specific number
The statement specifies ""an extra 8 million Americans."" To determine the accuracy of this number, we would need to look at projections made around that time. However, without specific data or projections from 2011 to compare, we must consider the general trend and impact of the ACA on Medicaid enrollment.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Phil Gingrey, who at the time was a U.S. Representative. Politicians' statements can sometimes be influenced by their political stance, but in this case, we are evaluating the factual accuracy of the projection rather than its political implications.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the context of the ACA's implementation and its aim to expand Medicaid, the statement about an increase in Medicaid enrollment is plausible. However, without specific data to confirm the exact number of 8 million, we must consider if this is an accurate projection based on the information available at the time.

The statement claims that not even General Eisenhower, as president, saluted military personnel. This implies that President Eisenhower, who was a general before becoming president, did not follow the traditional protocol of saluting military personnel during his presidency.

## Step 2: Consider the context and historical accuracy
Historically, it is known that Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, was indeed a five-star general in the United States Army before he became president. As a president who came from a military background, his behavior and protocols might have been scrutinized closely.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim
The claim that ""not even old Gen. Eisenhower saluted military personnel"" as president needs verification. Typically, the President of the United States, as the Commander-in-Chief, does salute military personnel as a sign of respect and protocol. However, there might be instances or specific contexts where this did not occur, which could be due to various reasons including personal preference, specific circumstances, or adherence to certain protocols.

## Step 4: Consider the source and date
The statement is attributed to Rachel Maddow, a political commentator, on March 27, 2012. While Rachel Maddow is known for fact-based commentary, the accuracy of the statement still needs to be verified against historical records and presidential protocols.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
After considering the context and the need for historical accuracy, it's crucial to verify if there are any records or instances where President Eisenhower did or did not salute military personnel. Without specific evidence or context indicating that Eisenhower never saluted military personnel, the statement could be misleading or inaccurate.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Given the information and the process of evaluation, the statement seems to lack specific evidence or context that would make it entirely accurate. The claim about President Eisenhower's behavior as it pertains to saluting military personnel needs clarification or additional information to be deemed accurate.

The key claim is that ""Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city.""

## Step 2: Consider the source of the statement
The source is Rahm Emanuel, who was the Mayor of Chicago at the time of the statement. This is relevant because mayors often have access to city data and statistics.

## Step 3: Evaluate the date of the statement
The statement was made on 1/9/2018. This date is important because it provides a specific point in time to verify the claim.

## Step 4: Assess the claim's verifiability
To verify the claim, one would need access to historical employment data for Chicago's private sector. This data is typically collected and reported by government agencies or economic research institutions.

## Step 5: Consider potential biases or motivations
As the Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel might have a positive bias towards the city's economic performance. However, this does not necessarily mean the statement is false, but it's a factor to consider when evaluating the claim.

## Step 6: Determine the availability of evidence
Without direct access to historical employment data for Chicago as of 1/9/2018, it's challenging to immediately verify the claim. However, the statement's specificity suggests it could be verified with the right data.

## Step 7: Evaluate the claim based on the given criteria
Given the lack of immediate evidence to the contrary and considering the source, the statement could potentially be true. However, without specific data or a clear source for the claim, it's difficult to label it as entirely true without reservation.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/24/2015, which is during a period when the 2016 presidential election campaigns were starting to take shape. Hillary Clinton was a leading Democratic candidate, and Rand Paul was a potential Republican candidate.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of polling data from that time
In early 2015, there were indeed polls comparing various Republican candidates against Hillary Clinton in hypothetical matchups. These polls were conducted by different organizations and had varying results.

## Step 4: Assess the claim in light of typical polling variability
Polls from that time showed different levels of support for various Republican candidates against Hillary Clinton. The performance of candidates can vary significantly from one poll to another based on the pollster, methodology, and timing.

## Step 5: Consider the potential for Rand Paul's statement to be accurate
Given the variability in polling data, it's possible that at the time of the statement, there was at least one poll that showed Rand Paul performing as well as or better than other Republican candidates against Hillary Clinton. However, without specific poll data to support the claim, it's difficult to verify the statement's accuracy comprehensively.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
The statement could be seen as partially accurate, as it's plausible that Rand Paul was performing well in some polls against Hillary Clinton at the time.

The key claim is that ""$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on origami condoms.""

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential implications of the claim
The claim involves the allocation of funds by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a specific project related to origami condoms. This context suggests that the claim could be related to research or development in the field of public health or sexual health.

## Step 3: Evaluate the credibility of the source
The source of the statement is Rand Paul, a U.S. politician. While politicians can be credible sources of information, their statements can also be influenced by political agendas or biases.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of evidence to support the claim
Without direct access to NIH funding records or specific project details from 2014, it's challenging to verify the exact amount spent on origami condoms. However, the claim's specificity suggests that it might be based on actual funding allocations.

## Step 5: Consider the date of the statement and potential changes over time
The statement was made in 2014. Funding priorities and allocations can change over time, but this does not directly impact the truthfulness of the statement at the time it was made.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of direct evidence to confirm or deny the statement and considering that the claim could be based on real funding allocations but might lack context or be misleading, the most appropriate label would reflect that the statement could have some basis in fact but might not tell the whole story or could be misleading without additional context.

The statement given is ""I haven't really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past"" by Rand Paul, dated 8/4/2014.

## Step 2: Research Rand Paul's past statements on aid to Israel
To assess the accuracy of the statement, we need to look into Rand Paul's past statements and actions regarding aid to Israel. In 2011, Rand Paul proposed a budget that would have cut all foreign aid, including aid to Israel. This is a critical piece of information because it directly pertains to the statement in question.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement against the research findings
Given that Rand Paul did propose cutting aid to Israel in the past, specifically in 2011 as part of a broader proposal to cut all foreign aid, the statement ""I haven't really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past"" can be evaluated for its accuracy.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Considering the evidence from 2011, it is clear that Rand Paul did propose phasing out or cutting aid to Israel as part of his broader foreign aid reduction proposals. Therefore, the statement made in 2014 is not accurate because it contradicts his past actions and proposals.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the evaluation criteria

The statement claims that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/16/2015 by Randy Forbes. This context is important for understanding the relevance and accuracy of the claim at the time it was made.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the claim
As of the statement's date, the United States does not have an official language at the federal level, although English is the most widely spoken language and is often used as a de facto national language. Many other countries have official languages designated by their governments.

## Step 4: Determine the truthfulness of the statement
Given that the U.S. does not have a federally recognized official language, the statement is accurate in saying the U.S. is among the few nations without an official language. However, it's also important to note that many countries have multiple official languages, and the statement might be considered to lack context regarding the diversity of language policies worldwide.

## Step 5: Choose the appropriate label based on the evaluation

## Step 3: Evaluate the available information on Rebecca Kleefisch's tenure and policies
As Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, Rebecca Kleefisch served under Governor Scott Walker. During their administration, there were several tax cuts implemented in Wisconsin.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement based on known policies and actions
Given that tax cuts were indeed part of the policies implemented during the Walker-Kleefisch administration, it is reasonable to conclude that Rebecca Kleefisch, as part of that administration, would have supported and been involved in cutting taxes.

## Step 5: Consider if there are any significant omissions or need for clarification
While the statement is straightforward, its accuracy depends on the specifics of the tax cuts and the role Kleefisch played in their implementation. However, without explicit details on the types of taxes cut or the extent of her involvement, the statement might be seen as lacking specificity but not necessarily false.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation

## Step 3: Evaluate the context and potential for bias
Given that the statement comes from a political figure with a potential bias against Hillary Clinton, it's essential to consider if the statement is presented in a way that could be misleading or if it lacks context.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of factual support
Without specific polling data or sources cited in the statement, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim directly. However, it's known that approval ratings can fluctuate based on various factors, including current events and the political climate.

The statement is about Sen. Jeff Sessions and his alleged comments on immigrants volunteering to serve in the armed forces, specifically comparing the likelihood of someone from Cullman, Alabama, versus someone from Kenya being a spy.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential sources of the statement
The statement is attributed to Richard Durbin, and the date is given as 1/10/2017. This context suggests the statement might have been made during a Senate hearing or a public address, possibly related to Sessions' nomination or confirmation process for a position, given the timing.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of evidence
Without direct access to transcripts or recordings from the specified date and context, it's challenging to verify the exact words or the context in which they were spoken. However, given the nature of the statement, it seems to be referencing a specific event or hearing where Sessions' views on immigration and national security were discussed.

## Step 4: Consider the implications of the statement
The statement implies that Sessions expressed a bias against immigrants from certain countries, suggesting they might be more likely to be spies. This kind of statement could be controversial and is the kind of thing that would be reported or discussed in political or fact-checking contexts.

## Step 5: Assess the credibility of the source
Richard Durbin, as a senator, is a credible source for statements made in official capacities. However, the accuracy of the quote and the context in which it was said would need verification to ensure it wasn't taken out of context or misrepresented.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on available information
Given the information available and the process of analysis, without direct evidence or a clear record of Sessions making these exact comments, the statement's accuracy cannot be confirmed. However, considering the context and the nature of political discourse, it's plausible that such a statement could have been made, but without further verification, it cannot be labeled as true or false with certainty.

The key claim is that President Obama said the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history during his visit to El Paso.

## Step 2: Determine the context and date of the statement
The statement was made by Rick Perry on 8/13/2011, regarding a visit by President Obama to El Paso.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the claim
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to verify if President Obama indeed made such a claim during his visit to El Paso. On May 10, 2011, President Obama did visit El Paso and discussed border security. According to reports from that time, he emphasized the progress made in securing the border but did not explicitly say it was safer than it ever was in history in the context that would make the statement entirely accurate without additional context.

## Step 4: Consider the source and potential biases
The statement is from Rick Perry, who at the time was a potential political opponent of President Obama, which might introduce a bias in how the statement is presented or interpreted.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the evaluation

The key claim is that the government, specifically mentioned in the context of Washington, has the authority to dictate the type of light bulb individuals can use.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on November 2, 2010, by Rick Perry. This date is significant because it falls after the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 was passed, which included provisions related to energy efficiency standards for lighting.

## Step 3: Recall relevant legislation around the time of the statement
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 phased out the use of incandescent bulbs in favor of more energy-efficient options like compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) starting from 2012. This act indeed set standards for light bulb efficiency, which could be interpreted as the government telling people what kind of light bulbs they can use.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement for accuracy
Given the context of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the statement that Washington's reach extends to ""even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use"" can be seen as having a basis in fact. The government did set standards that effectively limited the types of light bulbs that could be manufactured and sold, aiming for greater energy efficiency.

## Step 5: Determine the level of truth in the statement
While the statement might be seen as an exaggeration or simplification of the government's role in regulating light bulb standards, it is not entirely inaccurate. The government did intervene in the market by setting efficiency standards that would phase out traditional incandescent bulbs. However, the statement could be misleading by implying a direct dictate on individual choice rather than a regulation on manufacturers.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the statement has a basis in fact due to the energy efficiency standards set by the government but might be misleading in its implication of direct control over individual choices, the most appropriate label would be ""mostly true."" This is because the statement needs clarification regarding the nature of the government's intervention (regulating manufacturers rather than individual choices) but is not entirely false.

The statement claims that ""Everyone in this country has access to health care,"" as said by Rick Perry on 4/15/2010.

## Step 2: Consider the context of the statement
Given the date of the statement (4/15/2010), it's essential to consider the healthcare landscape in the United States at that time. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was signed into law on March 23, 2010, just a few weeks before the statement was made. However, the major provisions of the ACA, including the expansion of health insurance coverage to more Americans, had not yet taken effect.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Before the ACA's major provisions took effect, there were significant gaps in healthcare access in the United States. Many individuals, especially those with lower incomes or pre-existing conditions, faced barriers to accessing health care due to lack of insurance or high costs. While it was technically possible for anyone to receive emergency care as mandated by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), this did not equate to comprehensive access to health care for all.

## Step 4: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the context and the state of healthcare access in the U.S. at the time, the statement ""Everyone in this country has access to health care"" is misleading. It does not accurately reflect the challenges many people faced in accessing comprehensive, non-emergency healthcare services. The statement ignores critical facts about the barriers to healthcare access that existed before the ACA's major provisions took effect.

The statement is made by Rick Perry on April 5, 2013, regarding a letter he sent to Barack Obama in August 2010 about border security requests.

## Step 2: Evaluate the timeframe for a response
Given that the statement was made on April 5, 2013, and the letter was sent in August 2010, there is a significant timeframe (almost 3 years) during which a response could have been expected.

## Step 3: Consider the nature of the statement
The statement claims that Rick Perry has ""yet to get a response"" from Barack Obama. This implies that as of April 5, 2013, Perry had not received any form of response to his letter.

## Step 4: Assess the possibility of a response
Without direct evidence of whether a response was sent or not, we must consider the plausibility of the statement. It is possible that a response could have been sent but not received or acknowledged by Perry, or that no response was indeed given.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on available information
Given the lack of direct evidence to confirm or deny the receipt of a response and considering the significant timeframe, the statement could be seen as plausible but lacks concrete evidence to support its absolute truth. However, without explicit evidence to the contrary, we cannot definitively label it as false. The statement's truthfulness hinges on the assumption that no response was given, which could be true but needs clarification or additional information to be confirmed.

The statement was made by Rick Perry on August 18, 2010, regarding Bill White's debate participation.

## Step 2: Consider the source of the statement
The source of the statement is Rick Perry, who is likely to have a vested interest in the outcome of the debate or election, which could influence the accuracy of the statement.

## Step 3: Assess the statement's claim
The statement claims that Bill White is refusing to debate. Without additional context or information about the debates in question, the conditions set for the debates, or Bill White's actual stance on debating, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of this claim directly.

## Step 4: Determine the potential for bias
Given that the statement comes from an opponent (Rick Perry) in a political context, there's a high potential for bias or selective presentation of facts to sway public opinion.

## Step 5: Consider the date and potential for outdated information
The statement is from 2010. Political situations and stances can change rapidly, so without confirmation of Bill White's debate participation or refusal around that specific time, it's challenging to verify the statement's accuracy.

## Step 6: Evaluate the need for additional information
To accurately label this statement, more information is needed about Bill White's actual position on debating at the time, any conditions he may have set for participating in debates, and whether Rick Perry's characterization of ""refusing to debate"" is fair and accurate.

## Step 7: Conclusion based on available information
Given the potential for bias, the lack of detailed context, and the need for additional information to verify the claim, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely true without further evidence. However, it also does not appear to be completely false or implausible based solely on the information provided.

To assess the truthfulness of Rick Perry's statement, we first need to verify if Paint Creek, Texas, indeed does not have a ZIP code. This requires checking the United States Postal Service (USPS) database or other reliable sources for ZIP code information as of the statement's date, August 14, 2011.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential for change over time.
ZIP codes and postal designations can change over time due to various factors, including population growth, postal service adjustments, or other administrative changes. Therefore, it's essential to consider the specific date of the statement (8/14/2011) and ensure that any information used for verification is relevant to that time frame.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria provided.
Given the criteria for labeling the statement (true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, implausible), we must evaluate the accuracy of the claim that Paint Creek, Texas, does not have a ZIP code as of August 14, 2011. If Paint Creek indeed lacked a ZIP code at that time, the statement would be considered true. If there were nuances or the situation was more complex (e.g., it had a ZIP code but with specific conditions or shared with another location), the statement might be labeled as mostly true, half true, or mostly false, depending on the details.

## Step 4: Conclusion based on the evaluation.
Without direct access to historical ZIP code data for Paint Creek, Texas, as of August 14, 2011, we cannot definitively conclude the accuracy of the statement. However, the process involves checking historical postal records or databases that track changes in ZIP codes over time. If such information confirms that Paint Creek did not have a ZIP code on the specified date, the statement would be true. Otherwise, it would be labeled according to the extent of its inaccuracy or the complexity of the situation.

The statement made by Rick Perry on 8/17/2011 suggests that scientists are questioning the idea that man-made global warming is the cause of climate change, implying that this notion is becoming increasingly doubtful.

## Step 2: Evaluating the context of the statement
As of 2011, the scientific consensus on climate change, as reflected in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other scientific bodies, was that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, were significantly contributing to global warming and climate change.

## Step 3: Assessing the scientific consensus
The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agreed, and continue to agree, that human-induced global warming is a real and significant factor in climate change. This consensus is based on decades of research, including temperature records, shrinking ice sheets, glacier retreat, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events.

## Step 4: Considering the source and date
Rick Perry's statement in 2011 reflects a political stance rather than a scientific consensus. While there may have been, and continues to be, scientific debate about the details of climate change, such as the exact rate of warming or the impact of specific factors, the fundamental role of human activities in causing global warming was not, and is not, significantly ""in question"" among the scientific community.

## Step 5: Labeling the statement

The statement claims that the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on February 19, 2012, by Rick Santorum. This was during a presidential election year, and such proposals would have been part of the political discourse.

## Step 3: Recall relevant policies or proposals from that time
In 2011 and 2012, President Barack Obama proposed limiting itemized deductions, including charitable deductions, for higher-income taxpayers as part of his budget proposals. This was aimed at reducing the deficit and making the tax system more progressive.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given the context and the policies proposed by President Obama around that time, the statement that the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers needs to be assessed for its accuracy. The proposal was indeed to limit these deductions, not necessarily to eliminate them entirely.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement

The key claim is that poverty levels for African-American children went down to the lowest level ever as a result of welfare reform.

## Step 2: Consider the context of welfare reform
Welfare reform in the United States, notably the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, aimed to reduce dependency on government assistance by promoting work and self-sufficiency.

## Step 3: Evaluate the impact on poverty levels
Research indicates that in the years following the welfare reform, there was a decline in poverty rates among various demographics, including African-American children, due to a combination of factors including a strong economy and the reform itself.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy
Given the data available up to 2012, it is plausible that welfare reform contributed to a decline in poverty levels among African-American children. However, attributing the decline solely to welfare reform might overlook other contributing factors such as economic growth and other social policies.

The statement made by Rick Scott on June 29, 2012, claims that a company with 20 employees could go out of business due to health care law requirements to buy insurance. This statement is related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which was passed in 2010 and had various provisions being implemented around that time.

## Step 2: Identify key components of the statement
The key components are the number of employees (20), the potential outcome (going out of business), and the reason (health care law requirements to buy insurance). The ACA indeed had provisions that required certain employers to offer health insurance to their employees or face penalties, but the specifics, such as the number of employees that triggered these requirements, are crucial for evaluating the statement's accuracy.

## Step 3: Evaluate the ACA's employer mandate
The ACA's employer mandate, which was set to take effect in 2014 (after the statement was made), required employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees to offer health insurance to their employees or face penalties. This is a critical piece of information because it directly addresses the requirement to buy insurance based on the number of employees.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy
Given that the employer mandate applied to companies with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees, a company with exactly 20 employees would not be subject to the mandate. Therefore, the statement that a company with ""20 employees"" could go ""out of business"" because of health care law requirements to buy insurance is not accurate based on the specifics of the ACA's employer mandate.

## Step 3: Research the positions of Bill McCollum and Barack Obama on embryonic stem cell research as of 2010
As of 2010, Barack Obama was known for supporting embryonic stem cell research, having lifted restrictions on federal funding for it in 2009. Bill McCollum, on the other hand, was the Attorney General of Florida at the time and was running for governor. His stance on embryonic stem cell research would need to align with or diverge from Obama's to assess the truth of the statement.

## Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on the research
Without specific information on Bill McCollum's stance on embryonic stem cell research as of 2010, it's challenging to directly confirm or deny the statement. However, given the political context, it's unlikely that a Republican candidate like McCollum would hold the exact same position as a Democratic president like Obama on a controversial issue like embryonic stem cell research.

Given the lack of direct access to voting records and the potential for political bias, the statement could be seen as partially accurate but might omit important details or context about the votes, such as the nature of the taxes and fees, the circumstances of the votes, or the overall voting record of McCollum.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the potential for the statement to be partially accurate but lacking in detail or context, and without specific evidence to fully support or refute the claim, the most appropriate label would be ""half true."" This reflects that while McCollum may have voted for higher taxes and fees, the statement might not provide a complete or nuanced picture of his voting record.

mostly-false,Rick Scott,"""We are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years.""",5/20/2013,other,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/may/20/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-sticking-altered-700000-jobs-promis/,half true,"## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement
The statement claims that as of May 20, 2013, they are almost halfway to their 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years.

## Step 2: Calculate the halfway point of the job creation goal
To be halfway to the goal of creating 700,000 new jobs, they would need to have created 350,000 jobs (700,000 / 2 = 350,000).

## Step 3: Consider the timeframe
The goal was set in 2010 to create 700,000 new jobs in seven years, which means the deadline for achieving this goal would be 2017. As of May 20, 2013, they are roughly 3 years into this 7-year plan.

## Step 4: Evaluate the progress
To be ""almost halfway"" in terms of time, considering the goal is to be completed by 2017, they should be close to having created 350,000 jobs by May 2013, given that the halfway point in time would be around the end of 2013 or beginning of 2014.

## Step 5: Assess the statement without specific job creation numbers
Without the exact number of jobs created as of May 20, 2013, it's challenging to definitively label the statement. However, we can consider the context and the typical pace of job creation.

## Step 6: Consider the source and potential biases
The statement is from Rick Scott, who, as a political figure, may have an interest in presenting job creation in a positive light. This could influence the accuracy of the claim.

## Step 7: Determine the label based on available information
Given the lack of specific job creation numbers and considering the timeframe, the statement seems to be an assessment of progress rather than a factually detailed report. Without concrete numbers to support or refute the claim directly, we must consider the context and the nature of political statements.

The statement claims that ""Bill McCollum has accepted thousands from lobbyists for Planned Parenthood."" This implies that Bill McCollum received financial contributions from lobbyists who work for or are associated with Planned Parenthood.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential implications
Given the date (6/23/2010) and the source (Rick Scott), who was likely a political opponent of Bill McCollum at the time, the statement could be part of a political campaign strategy to influence public opinion. The mention of Planned Parenthood, an organization often at the center of political debates, especially regarding abortion and healthcare, adds a layer of controversy.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on available information
Without direct access to financial records or statements from Bill McCollum's campaign at the time, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim directly. However, the statement's specificity (""thousands from lobbyists for Planned Parenthood"") suggests it could be based on some form of evidence or research, possibly from campaign finance records.

## Step 4: Consider the potential for the statement to be misleading
Even if Bill McCollum did accept contributions from lobbyists associated with Planned Parenthood, the statement's implications depend on the context. For example, the amount (""thousands"") might be significant or negligible depending on the total campaign finances. Additionally, the statement does not provide information on McCollum's stance on issues related to Planned Parenthood or whether these contributions influenced his decisions.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis
Given the lack of direct evidence to confirm or deny the statement and considering the potential for the statement to be used in a political context to sway opinion, the most appropriate label would reflect that the statement could be partially accurate but lacks sufficient context or detail to be fully verified.

The statement claims that the Paris Climate Agreement is ""bad for America"" because it allegedly does nothing to hold major polluters like China and India accountable. This statement was made by Rick Scott on January 20, 2021.

## Step 2: Evaluating the Paris Climate Agreement
The Paris Climate Agreement, signed in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It requires countries to set and meet their own greenhouse gas emission targets, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are to be increased in ambition every five years.

## Step 3: Assessing Accountability of Major Polluters
China and India, among the world's largest emitters, have indeed made commitments under the Paris Agreement. China aims to peak its carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. India targets reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 33-35% below 2005 levels by 2030 and increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix.

## Step 4: Analyzing the Statement's Claims
The statement suggests that the Paris Agreement does not hold China and India accountable. However, the agreement's structure, based on voluntary NDCs, does indeed allow countries to set their own targets, which could be seen as lacking in stringent enforcement mechanisms. Yet, it does provide a framework for transparency and review, including regular global stocktakes to assess collective progress towards the agreement's goals.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Given the information, the statement that the Paris Climate Agreement is ""bad for America"" because it ""does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable"" is misleading. While the agreement may not have the strictest enforcement mechanisms, it does establish a framework for countries to make and meet commitments, including China and India. The statement ignores the agreement's provisions for transparency, review, and the incremental increase in ambition over time.

mostly-false,Rick Scott,"""The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare.""",5/06/2015,news,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/may/11/rick-scott/patients-who-use-lip-are-different-medicaid-expans/,mostly true,"## Step 1: Understand the context of the statement
The statement made by Rick Scott on 5/6/2015 refers to the Low Income Pool (LIP) and Obamacare, which are two different healthcare programs. The LIP is a program that provides funding to hospitals for uncompensated care, primarily for low-income individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid. Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a comprehensive healthcare reform law that includes provisions for expanding Medicaid and creating health insurance marketplaces.

## Step 2: Determine the relationship between LIP and Obamacare
The Low Income Pool and Obamacare are related in the sense that they both aim to provide healthcare access to low-income individuals. However, they serve different populations and have different funding mechanisms. The LIP primarily focuses on providing funding for uncompensated care to hospitals, while Obamacare expands health insurance coverage through Medicaid expansion and the health insurance marketplaces.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement
Given the context and the relationship between LIP and Obamacare, the statement that ""The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare"" can be evaluated. While there might be some overlap in the populations served, the primary groups targeted by these programs are different. LIP is more focused on those who do not qualify for Medicaid or other insurance, including undocumented immigrants and those who cannot afford insurance even with subsidies.

## Step 4: Consider the date and source of the statement
The statement was made in 2015 by Rick Scott, who was the Governor of Florida at the time. This period was significant for healthcare policy, as the ACA was being implemented, and states were making decisions about Medicaid expansion. Florida, under Governor Scott, did not expand Medicaid, which affected how programs like LIP were utilized to cover low-income individuals.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on the evaluation
Considering the information and the context in which the statement was made, it appears that the statement is generally accurate. The populations served by LIP and those covered by Obamacare (through Medicaid expansion or marketplace plans) are largely distinct, although there could be some overlap. The statement does not account for potential overlaps or the complexities of healthcare coverage for low-income individuals, but it does not outright misrepresent the primary distinction between the two groups.

The key claim is that for the first time ever, the critical needs waiting list was completely funded, allowing persons with unique abilities to get the help they need.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on January 12, 2016, by Rick Scott. This context is crucial for verifying the claim as it specifies a particular point in time and the person making the claim.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of information to verify the claim
Without access to specific data or reports from 2016 regarding the funding of the critical needs waiting list, it's challenging to directly verify the accuracy of the statement. However, the claim can be assessed based on its plausibility and the typical challenges associated with fully funding such lists.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility of the claim
Fully funding a critical needs waiting list is a significant achievement, especially if it's claimed to be the first time ever. Such lists often have substantial financial requirements, and fully funding them can be a complex task due to budget constraints and the ongoing nature of the needs.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Rick Scott, who, as a public figure, has access to information about state budgets and initiatives. However, political statements can sometimes be subject to interpretation or spin.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of direct evidence to verify the claim and considering the context, the statement seems to be a positive assertion about an achievement.

The key claim is that ""almost nine out of 10"" jobs lost in Ohio during Lee Fisher's watch were lost to other states, not to other countries.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on September 14, 2010, by Rob Portman, which suggests it was made during a political campaign or debate, possibly in the context of the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Ohio.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of data to support the claim
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we would need data on job losses in Ohio during Lee Fisher's tenure, specifically data that differentiates between jobs lost to other states and those lost to other countries.

## Step 4: Consider the potential for bias in the statement
Given that the statement was made by a political opponent (Rob Portman) of Lee Fisher, there is a potential for bias or selective presentation of facts to discredit Fisher.

## Step 5: Assess the plausibility of the claim without specific data
Without access to specific data or reports from 2010 that detail the nature of job losses in Ohio, it's challenging to directly verify the claim. However, the statement's specificity (""almost nine out of 10"") suggests it might be based on some form of analysis or data.

## Step 6: Determine the appropriate label based on the analysis

The key claim is that EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent in July, and this increase is at the expense of the US market share, affecting US farmers and service providers.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 9/7/2011. This is important because trade agreements and economic data can change over time. The EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed in October 2010 and came into effect on July 1, 2011, which could significantly impact trade between the EU and South Korea.

## Step 3: Evaluate the potential impact of the EU-Korea FTA
Given that the FTA came into effect in July 2011, it is plausible that EU exports to South Korea could have increased significantly in the first month of the agreement's implementation due to reduced tariffs and other trade barriers.

## Step 4: Assess the claim about US market share
The statement implies that the increase in EU exports to South Korea comes at the expense of US market share. This could be true if US exporters were not able to compete as effectively with EU exporters due to the new FTA, assuming the US did not have a similar agreement in place at the time.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Without specific data on EU exports to South Korea for July 2011 and the comparative market share of the US, it's difficult to verify the exact percentage increase and its impact on US farmers and service providers. However, the context provided by the implementation of the EU-Korea FTA makes the claim plausible.

## Step 6: Consider the availability of trade data
Trade data that could confirm or deny the specific percentage increase in EU exports to South Korea in July 2011 might not be readily available or could vary depending on the source. However, the general trend of increased trade following the implementation of a free trade agreement is consistent with economic principles.

## Step 7: Label the statement based on the analysis
Given the plausible context and the potential for the statement to be accurate based on the implementation of the EU-Korea FTA, but lacking specific data to confirm the exact percentage and its direct impact on US market share, the statement is likely to be considered ""mostly true"" as it reflects a situation that could have occurred given the economic context, but might need additional information",R,economy,10000-50000

The statement is about red-flag laws and how Democrats allegedly want to take away guns from individuals who might do something, making them prove they wouldn't do it.

## Step 2: Understand the context of red-flag laws
Red-flag laws allow authorities to temporarily confiscate guns from individuals deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. The process typically involves a court order and is based on evidence or credible threats.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
The statement simplifies and misrepresents the purpose and process of red-flag laws. It implies that Democrats want to take away guns without due process, which is not entirely accurate. Red-flag laws do involve a legal process and are intended to prevent harm, not simply to take away guns based on speculation.

The statement was made by Robin Vos on 11/10/2019. As a political figure, the statement may reflect a partisan view rather than a neutral or factual explanation of red-flag laws.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Given the simplification, misrepresentation, and potential partisan bias, the statement does not accurately reflect the purpose and process of red-flag laws.

The statement claims that the Obama administration admitted money from the Iran nuclear deal would go directly to terrorism.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on January 22, 2016. The Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was agreed upon on July 14, 2015. This context is crucial for understanding the potential implications and admissions related to the deal.

## Step 3: Evaluate the Obama administration's stance and admissions
The Obama administration did acknowledge that some of the money Iran received as a result of the deal could potentially be used to fund terrorism. However, the administration also emphasized that the deal was primarily aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons and that the economic benefits to Iran were a consequence of the lifting of sanctions, not a direct intention to fund terrorism.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the administration's acknowledgments and the context of the deal, it is accurate to say that there was an understanding that some funds could end up supporting terrorism. However, the statement simplifies the administration's position and the complexities of the deal.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the evaluation
The statement is partially accurate in that it reflects concerns and acknowledgments about the potential use of funds. However, it omits important details about the deal's primary goals and the administration's stance on terrorism funding, which could give a different impression.

The statement claims that Chicago has the most stringent gun laws and the highest murder rate in the country.

## Step 2: Evaluate the claim about Chicago's gun laws
As of the statement's date (2/18/2014), Chicago did have strict gun laws, including a ban on handguns that was upheld until the Supreme Court's decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), which struck down the ban. However, even after the ban was lifted, Chicago maintained strict regulations on gun ownership and sales.

## Step 3: Assess the claim about Chicago's murder rate
According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which collects and analyzes crime data from law enforcement agencies across the United States, in 2013 (the year before the statement was made), Chicago did have a high murder rate. However, whether it was the ""highest"" depends on the specific metric used (e.g., per capita, total number of murders). Chicago often ranked high in terms of total murders due to its large population, but its per capita murder rate, while high, was not always the highest in the country.

## Step 4: Consider the relationship between gun laws and murder rates
Research on the relationship between gun laws and murder rates is complex and often controversial. Some studies suggest that stricter gun laws can lead to lower rates of gun violence, while others argue that the relationship is not so straightforward, citing factors such as enforcement, neighboring jurisdictions' laws, and socioeconomic conditions.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information available up to 2014, Chicago did have strict gun laws and a high murder rate. However, the statement simplifies a complex issue by implying a direct correlation between the two without considering other factors that contribute to murder rates, such as poverty, policing strategies, and the availability of guns from neighboring areas with less stringent laws.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
The statement contains elements of truth (Chicago's strict gun laws and high murder rate) but lacks critical context and oversimplifies the relationship between these factors. Therefore, it does not fully capture the complexity of the issue.

The statement claims that ""The average rate of fraud"" in several government programs, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps, ""is 20 to 25 percent."" This statement was made by Ron Johnson on January 10, 2014.

## Step 2: Evaluate the context and available data
To assess the accuracy of the statement, we need to consider the context and available data from 2014 regarding fraud rates in these programs. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP) are all subject to various forms of fraud, but the rates can vary significantly from one program to another.

## Step 3: Consider the fraud rates in each program
- **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC):** The IRS has reported that the EITC has one of the highest improper payment rates among federal programs, with estimates suggesting it could be as high as 20-25% in some years, though this can vary.
- **Medicare:** Fraud rates in Medicare are significant but vary by type. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reports on improper payment rates, which include fraud, but these rates are generally lower than 10%.
- **Medicaid:** Like Medicare, Medicaid's improper payment rates are reported by CMS and can vary, but they are typically lower than those of the EITC.
- **Food Stamps (SNAP):** The fraud rate in SNAP is generally considered to be low, with the USDA reporting error rates (which include fraud) of around 3-4%.

## Step 4: Assess the statement's accuracy
Given the variability in fraud rates across these programs, a blanket statement of ""20 to 25 percent"" average fraud rate seems inaccurate. While the EITC might approach this range in some years, the other programs typically have lower fraud rates. Thus, averaging them together at 20-25% does not accurately reflect the situation across all these programs.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the information above, the statement is not entirely accurate because it generalizes the fraud rate across different programs with significantly varying rates of fraud. It contains an element of truth, particularly regarding the EITC, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression when considering all the mentioned","## Step 1: Identify the statement and its components

The key claim in the statement is that ""Bill Clinton cut the military drastically.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and historical data
During Bill Clinton's presidency, which spanned from 1993 to 2001, there were indeed reductions in military spending and personnel. This was largely a response to the end of the Cold War and the resulting ""peace dividend."" The military budget was reduced, and the number of active-duty personnel decreased.

## Step 3: Evaluate the extent of the cuts
While it is true that military spending and personnel numbers decreased during Clinton's presidency, the term ""drastically"" needs clarification. The reductions were significant but were part of a broader post-Cold War restructuring and downsizing of the military. The actual impact and the reasoning behind these cuts need to be considered for a full understanding.

## Step 4: Consider the source and potential biases
The statement comes from Rudy Giuliani, a political figure who might have had reasons to frame Clinton's policies in a certain light, especially during an election year (2008). This could imply a potential bias in how the information is presented.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the historical context, it is accurate that Bill Clinton's administration did reduce military spending and personnel. However, the characterization of these cuts as ""drastic"" could be seen as subjective and might depend on the perspective. The statement lacks nuance and does not provide a full context of why these cuts were made or their overall impact on the military and national security.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the statement is based on a factual event but lacks nuance and might be perceived as taking the cuts out of context by using the term ""drastically,"" it would be best described as ""half true.""

## Step 3: Confirm the release date of the hostages
The American hostages were released on January 20, 1981, which is the same day Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as the President of the United States.

## Step 4: Determine the timing of the release in relation to Reagan's inauguration
The hostages were released just minutes after Reagan took the Oath of Office, which aligns with the statement's claim.

## Step 5: Assess the accuracy of the statement

During this time, Barack Obama was the President of the United States. Any policies or actions attributed to him would have been part of his administration's initiatives.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for factual accuracy
The statement claims that people cannot go fishing anymore because of Obama. To assess its truthfulness, we need to consider if there were any significant changes or policies implemented by the Obama administration around that time that would have completely prohibited fishing.

## Step 4: Research relevant policies or events
In 2010, the Obama administration did implement various environmental and conservation policies, including those related to fishing and marine conservation. However, a complete ban on fishing for the general public would have been a significant and widely reported event.

## Step 5: Determine the impact of Obama's policies on fishing
While the Obama administration did introduce regulations and protected areas that might have limited fishing in certain zones or for specific species, there is no evidence to suggest a blanket ban on fishing for the general public that would support the statement's absolute claim.

## Step 6: Label the statement based on the evaluation
Given the lack of evidence supporting a complete ban on fishing due to Obama and considering that any restrictions would have been more nuanced and not a total prohibition, the statement is misleading and not supported by facts.

The statement claims there are ""high administrative costs"" associated with donating to Haiti relief through the White House Web site, as stated by Rush Limbaugh on January 18, 2010.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential implications
The context is a donation to Haiti relief, which implies a humanitarian effort. The implication of ""high administrative costs"" could deter people from donating through the mentioned channel, suggesting that a significant portion of their donation might not reach the intended recipients.

## Step 3: Evaluate the credibility of the source
Rush Limbaugh is a conservative commentator known for his opinions, which can sometimes be controversial or biased. This does not inherently make the statement false, but it necessitates a closer examination of the facts.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of factual support
Without specific data or a detailed breakdown of the administrative costs associated with donations through the White House Web site at the time, it's challenging to directly verify the claim. However, it's known that many charitable organizations and government initiatives strive to minimize administrative costs to maximize the impact of donations.

## Step 5: Consider the date and potential changes over time
The statement was made in 2010. Administrative costs and practices can change over time, but without information on the specific costs at that time, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of the statement directly.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of specific evidence to support or refute the claim directly and considering the potential for bias in the source, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely true or false without more information. However, the claim of ""high administrative costs"" could be misleading or lack context, as many organizations, especially in the context of disaster relief, aim to keep such costs low.

The statement claims that in the last four years, $36 million in ongoing revenue has been cut. This is attributed to Sam Adams.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement is 11/13/2012, we need to consider what was happening around that time, especially in relation to economic policies or budget cuts that might have been implemented by Sam Adams or his administration.

## Step 3: Evaluate the source of the statement
Sam Adams, presumably a public figure or politician, is the source of the statement. The credibility and reliability of the source are crucial in determining the accuracy of the statement.

## Step 4: Assess the availability of factual support
Without specific data or records from 2012 or the preceding four years, it's challenging to verify the claim directly. However, the statement's specificity ($36 million in ongoing revenue) suggests it should be verifiable through budget records or financial reports from the relevant period and jurisdiction.

## Step 5: Consider potential biases or motivations
As a public figure, Sam Adams might have reasons to either exaggerate or downplay budget cuts, depending on his political goals or the context in which the statement was made. Understanding the political climate and Adams' position at the time could provide insight into potential biases.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on available information
Given the lack of direct evidence or context provided in the question, and without access to specific budget data or records from the time, it's not possible to definitively label the statement as true, false, or any variation thereof based solely on the information given.

The statement provides specific annual funding amounts for three types of cancer research by the U.S. Department of Defense: $80 million for prostate cancer, $25 million for ovarian cancer, and $150 million for breast cancer.

## Step 2: Consider the source and date of the statement
The statement was made by Saxby Chambliss on 11/7/2013. Given that the source is a political figure and the date is specific, it's essential to verify the information through official or reputable sources to ensure accuracy.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility of the funding amounts
Without immediate access to the 2013 budget of the U.S. Department of Defense specifically for cancer research, it's challenging to verify the exact figures. However, the Department of Defense does allocate funds for cancer research through its Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP), which includes funding for various types of cancer.

## Step 4: Consider potential changes in funding over time
Funding for research can change annually based on budget allocations and priorities. The figures provided might have been accurate for the fiscal year 2013 or the year the statement was made but could have changed in subsequent years.

## Step 5: Assess the need for verification
Given the specificity of the statement and the potential for budget figures to fluctuate, verification through official Department of Defense budget documents or press releases from 2013 is necessary to confirm the accuracy of the statement.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on available information
Without direct access to the specific budget allocations for 2013 from the U.S. Department of Defense for prostate, ovarian, and breast cancer research, and considering the statement's specificity and the potential for annual budget changes, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely accurate without further verification.

The statement claims that due to reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend. This implies a direct financial benefit to families as a result of policy changes.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on September 18, 2014, by Scott Walker. This context is crucial as it relates to economic policies and their impact during that time period.

## Step 3: Evaluate the source of the statement
Scott Walker, as a political figure, has a vested interest in presenting his policies in a positive light. This does not inherently make the statement false, but it does suggest a need for scrutiny.

## Step 4: Assess the claim for factual support
Without specific data or a detailed explanation of the reforms and how they directly lead to an average family saving $322, the claim lacks concrete evidence. Economic outcomes can be complex and multifaceted, making broad statements about average savings challenging to verify without detailed analysis.

## Step 5: Consider potential biases and missing information
The statement does not provide information on how the $322 figure was calculated, the timeframe over which this savings would occur, or the specific reforms that led to this outcome. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim.

## Step 6: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of specific evidence, the potential for political bias, and the absence of detailed information on how the savings were calculated, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely accurate without further data.

The statement is made by Scott Walker on May 16, 2012, regarding new figures he released showing Wisconsin job gains for 2011, claiming these are ""the final job numbers.""

## Step 2: Consider the nature of job statistics
Job statistics, especially those related to employment rates and job gains, are typically subject to revision as more complete data becomes available. Initial releases of such data are often preliminary and may be adjusted over time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim of ""final job numbers""
Given the nature of statistical data, especially economic and employment data, it is unusual for any initial release to be considered ""final"" without the possibility of revision. Revisions can occur due to various factors, including updated surveys, more accurate reporting from businesses, or changes in methodology.

## Step 4: Consider the context of the statement's date and source
The statement was made in 2012 by a political figure, Scott Walker, who might have had an interest in presenting positive economic news. Political statements about economic data can sometimes be subject to interpretation or spin.

## Step 5: Determine the likelihood of the statement being true
Given that job statistics are often revised, it is unlikely that any initial release of job gain figures would be considered absolutely ""final"" without any possibility of revision. This suggests that the statement might not fully capture the potential for future adjustments to the data.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the potential for revisions to job statistics and the context in which the statement was made, the statement seems to be partially accurate but omits important details about the potential for future revisions.

To determine the accuracy of the statement, we need to consider the context and available data from the time it was made. The statement claims ""More than 70,000"" job openings are listed on a state jobs website as of September 20, 2014, by Scott Walker.

## Step 2: Consider the source and potential biases
Scott Walker, being a political figure, might have reasons to present data in a favorable light. However, without specific evidence of manipulation or distortion, we should focus on the verifiability of the claim itself.

## Step 3: Assess the availability of data
Given the date of the statement (9/20/2014), we would ideally look for official state job listings or reports from around that time to verify the number of job openings. However, without direct access to archives of the state's job website or official reports from that specific date, we must consider the plausibility based on economic conditions and job market trends of the time.

## Step 4: Consider the economic context of 2014
2014 was a year of economic recovery in the United States, following the 2008 financial crisis. Many states, including Wisconsin, were experiencing job growth. It's plausible that there could have been a significant number of job openings during this period of recovery.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on available information
Without direct evidence to confirm or deny the exact number of job openings (more than 70,000) on the state jobs website as of September 20, 2014, we must consider the statement's plausibility and the context in which it was made. Given the economic recovery and potential for job growth, the statement could be seen as plausible. However, without specific data to support the claim, we cannot definitively label it as true.

## Step 6: Choose the most appropriate label
Given the lack of specific evidence to confirm the statement and considering the potential for the statement to be an exaggeration or an underestimation without more context, the most appropriate label would reflect a balance between plausibility and lack of concrete evidence.

The statement claims that the Mary Burkes Madison school district will be the only school district left in the state to ignore Act 10 law in the 2015-16 school year, as stated by Scott Walker on 9/3/2014.

## Step 2: Consider the context and implications of Act 10
Act 10, also known as the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, was a law passed in 2011 that significantly changed the collective bargaining rights of public employees, including teachers. Ignoring this law would mean that a school district continues to engage in collective bargaining or provide benefits as if the law did not apply.

## Step 3: Evaluate the feasibility of a single district ignoring state law
Given the legal and political implications, it's unlikely that a single school district could openly ignore a state law without facing legal or administrative consequences. However, the statement's accuracy depends on the specific actions of the Mary Burkes Madison school district and other districts in relation to Act 10.

## Step 4: Assess the statement based on available information
Without specific details on how the Mary Burkes Madison school district and other districts in Wisconsin were complying with or ignoring Act 10 as of the 2015-16 school year, it's challenging to verify the statement's accuracy directly. However, considering the political context and the fact that Scott Walker, the governor who signed Act 10 into law, made the statement, it suggests a political rather than a purely factual assertion.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Given the lack of specific evidence to support the claim and considering the political context in which the statement was made, the statement seems to be more of a political assertion than a factually verified claim. However, without direct evidence to refute it, the statement cannot be labeled as false outright.

The statement made by Scott Walker on 12/12/2014 claims that his property taxes decreased significantly due to a 35.5% reduction in the technical college portion of his taxes, which he attributes to state funding.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential for verification
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we would ideally need access to Scott Walker's property tax records and the state's budget allocations to technical colleges around that time. However, given the constraints, we can consider general trends and policies that might support or refute the claim.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility based on known policies and trends
Scott Walker, as the Governor of Wisconsin, had implemented various policies affecting education and taxation. One notable aspect of his governance was the reduction in funding for certain public services, including education. However, the specific claim about a 35.5% reduction in the technical college portion of property taxes due to state funding increases would require detailed budget and tax records to verify.

## Step 4: Consider the potential for political bias or spin
As a political figure, Scott Walker's statements might be subject to political spin or selective presentation of facts. It's possible that the statement is framed to highlight a positive outcome of his policies without providing a full context of how these changes affected the broader population or the overall funding of technical colleges.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label based on available information
Given the lack of specific data to directly confirm or deny the 35.5% reduction and its cause, and considering the potential for political spin, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false without further information.

The key claim made by Scott Walker is that Wisconsin is investing more money into education than ever before in its history.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on February 8, 2017. This means we need to look at the budget and spending on education in Wisconsin up to that point to assess the claim.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available data on education spending in Wisconsin
To determine the accuracy of the statement, we would need to examine the historical budget allocations for education in Wisconsin. This includes looking at the total amount spent on education in previous years and comparing it to the amount allocated in the budget for the year the statement was made or the preceding years.

## Step 4: Assess the claim based on available information
Without specific data on the historical spending on education in Wisconsin, it's challenging to directly verify the claim. However, the claim can be assessed based on general trends and policies. If there were significant increases in education funding in the years leading up to 2017, the statement could be considered true or mostly true. Conversely, if funding had been stagnant or decreased, the statement would be false or mostly false.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Scott Walker, who was the Governor of Wisconsin at the time. As a political figure, his statements may be subject to political spin or selective presentation of facts. This means the claim should be scrutinized carefully against objective data.

## Step 6: Determine the label for the statement
Given the lack of specific data in the question to directly confirm or deny the statement, and considering the potential for political statements to be misleading or require additional context, the most appropriate approach is to consider the statement as needing verification. However, without explicit data to contradict the statement and considering it's a claim about historical investment which could be verified through budget records, the statement could lean towards being true if such investments were indeed made.

During the coronavirus pandemic, many state workers were indeed required to work from home or were furloughed due to lockdowns and social distancing measures. This could be perceived as being ""idle"" if one does not consider the nature of their work or the circumstances.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential biases of the source, Scott Walker.
Scott Walker, a former Governor of Wisconsin, has been known for his stance on public sector unions and state worker benefits. His perspective might be influenced by his political views, potentially leading to a biased interpretation of what it means for state workers to be ""idle"" during the pandemic.

## Step 3: Assess the need for clarification or additional information.
The statement lacks specificity regarding what is meant by ""idle."" If state workers were working from home or were on furlough due to pandemic restrictions, calling them ""idle"" might not accurately reflect their situation or the value of their work, even if it was not being performed in a traditional office setting.

## Step 4: Determine the label based on the analysis.
Given the potential for the statement to be misleading due to its lack of clarity and the context of the pandemic, where many workers were indeed at home but not necessarily ""idle,"" the statement seems to omit important details.

The statement claims that Wisconsin's ""rainy day fund"" is ""165 times bigger than when we first took office"" as of 8/3/2015, according to Scott Walker.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential for verification
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider the size of Wisconsin's rainy day fund at the beginning of Scott Walker's term and compare it to the size on the date of the statement (8/3/2015).

## Step 3: Recall or research the relevant data
As of the end of 2010, when Scott Walker first took office, Wisconsin's rainy day fund had a balance of about $1.7 million. By 2015, under Walker's administration, the fund had grown significantly.

## Step 4: Evaluate the growth of the rainy day fund
If the fund grew to a size that is 165 times larger than its initial size during Walker's term, we need to calculate what that would be. 165 times $1.7 million equals $280.5 million.

## Step 5: Compare with actual data from 2015
According to reports and budget documents from 2015, Wisconsin's rainy day fund indeed saw significant growth under Walker's administration. The actual balance as of 2015 needs to be verified to confirm if it matches or closely aligns with the ""165 times bigger"" claim.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available data
Given that the statement can be verified with actual data showing significant growth in the rainy day fund, and assuming the calculation of 165 times the initial amount aligns with the 2015 balance, the statement can be labeled as true, provided the actual 2015 balance of the rainy day fund is approximately $280.5 million or an amount that reasonably supports the claim of being 165 times larger.

To assess the accuracy of the statement made by Scott Walker on October 16, 2011, we need to consider data or reports from that time regarding the demographics of students entering technical schools in Wisconsin.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential sources of information that could support or refute the statement.
Given the date, we are looking for information from 2011 or studies and data analyses from around that period that discuss the educational background of students entering technical schools in Wisconsin.

## Step 3: Determine if there's any evidence to suggest that individuals with four-year degrees were indeed the largest category of people entering technical schools at that time.
Without specific data or studies cited directly in the statement or provided in the question, we must rely on general knowledge about educational trends and the purposes of technical schools. Technical schools often attract individuals seeking specific job skills, which can include those with prior degrees looking to transition careers or enhance their skills.

## Step 4: Assess the plausibility of the statement based on common trends in education and career development.
It's plausible that some individuals with four-year degrees might seek additional training in technical fields, either to enhance their job prospects, change careers, or acquire specific skills not covered in their initial degree programs. However, without concrete data, it's challenging to confirm if they constituted the ""largest category"" as of 2011.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on the evaluation.
Given the lack of specific data to directly support or refute the claim and considering the plausible scenarios where individuals with four-year degrees might enter technical schools, the statement's accuracy cannot be definitively confirmed without more information.

The statement claims that under President Barack Obama's jobs bill, an unemployed individual can sue if they believe they weren't hired because of their unemployment status.

## Step 2: Consider the context and the source of the statement
The statement was made by Sean Hannity on September 13, 2011. Given the political context and the source, it's essential to verify the information through neutral or fact-checking sources to ensure accuracy.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on known facts about the jobs bill
President Obama's jobs bill, officially known as the American Jobs Act, was proposed in 2011. A key provision in the bill aimed to prevent discrimination against unemployed job applicants. However, the specifics of how this provision would be enforced, including the possibility of lawsuits, need to be verified.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
After verifying, it was found that the American Jobs Act did indeed include a provision that would have made it illegal for employers to discriminate against unemployed job applicants. However, the mechanism for enforcement and the specifics of legal recourse, such as the ability to sue, need clarification. The statement simplifies the legal process and implications of the bill.

## Step 5: Label the statement based on its accuracy

The statement claims that there are more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining as of May 27, 2014.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given the date of the statement (May 27, 2014), we need to consider the employment trends in both the solar and coal mining industries around that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the solar industry job market in 2014
In 2014, the solar industry was experiencing significant growth due to declining solar panel costs and increasing demand for renewable energy. This growth likely led to an increase in employment opportunities within the sector.

## Step 4: Evaluate the coal mining industry job market in 2014
The coal mining industry, on the other hand, was facing challenges due to environmental regulations, competition from natural gas, and declining demand for coal. This could have resulted in a decrease in employment opportunities within the coal mining sector.

## Step 5: Compare the job numbers in both industries
According to a report by the Solar Foundation, the solar industry employed approximately 142,000 people in the United States as of 2013. In contrast, the coal mining industry employed around 87,000 people in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## Step 6: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the data from 2013, which is the closest available to the statement's date, it appears that the solar industry indeed had more jobs than the coal mining industry.

The key claim in the statement made by Tammy Baldwin on 5/4/2022 is that ""Our Supreme Court has never taken away a constitutional right.""

## Step 2: Consider historical context and Supreme Court decisions
Historically, the Supreme Court has made decisions that have both expanded and contracted individual rights. A notable example is the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), where the Court ruled that African Americans, whether free or slave, were not citizens and therefore had no right to sue in federal court, effectively taking away a constitutional right. Another significant case is Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which upheld the constitutionality of ""separate but equal"" facilities, thereby limiting the rights of African Americans. However, the most relevant example in recent context, especially considering the date of the statement (5/4/2022), would be the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade, which was a landmark decision that granted women the constitutional right to abortion.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement in light of the source and date

Jackson Women's Health Organization, which suggested the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, Tammy Baldwin's statement seems to be addressing the potential or impending action by the Supreme Court. The statement could be seen as a commentary on the historical role of the Supreme Court in either expanding or limiting constitutional rights.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
The statement ""Our Supreme Court has never taken away a constitutional right"" is not accurate. There have been instances where the Supreme Court has effectively taken away or limited constitutional rights, as mentioned in historical cases. The impending decision on Roe v. Wade, if it were to overturn the precedent, would also be an example of the Court taking away a constitutional right.

The key claim is that the Trump administration has banned the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) from using the word ""transgender"".

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on June 26, 2018. It's essential to consider any policies or announcements made by the Trump administration around that time regarding the CDC and the use of specific words.

## Step 3: Recall relevant information about the Trump administration's policies on LGBTQ+ issues
In 2017 and 2018, there were reports of the Trump administration considering or implementing policies that affected the LGBTQ+ community, including potential restrictions on language used in official documents and communications.

## Step 4: Evaluate the accuracy of the statement based on known facts
There were reports in December 2017 that the CDC was prohibited from using certain words, including ""transgender,"" in budget documents. This was part of a broader set of words that were allegedly banned, which also included ""fetus,"" ""diversity,"" ""entitlement,"" ""evidence-based,"" ""science-based,"" and ""vulnerable."" However, the context of this ban was specifically related to budget documents, not a blanket ban on using the word in all CDC communications.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement based on its accuracy and completeness
Given that there was a reported ban on using the word ""transgender"" in specific contexts (like budget documents) but not a complete ban on its use in all CDC communications, the statement needs clarification. It is partially accurate but omits important details about the scope of the ban.

The key claim is that except for Donald Trump, every other major party nominee for the past 40 years has released their tax returns.

## Step 2: Consider the historical context of presidential nominees and tax returns
Historically, it has been a common practice for major party presidential nominees to release their tax returns, although it is not required by law.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy based on known facts
Since 1980, most major party nominees have indeed released their tax returns. This includes nominees from both the Democratic and Republican parties, with the exception of Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

## Step 4: Determine if there are any exceptions or missing information
The only exception mentioned is Donald Trump, which is accurate as of the statement's date. There might be other minor party nominees who did not release their tax returns, but the statement specifically refers to ""major party nominees.""

## Step 5: Assess the statement's truthfulness based on the evaluation
Given the historical context and the specific exception of Donald Trump, the statement appears to be accurate. It reflects the common practice among major party nominees for the past 40 years, with Trump being the notable exception in recent history.

The key claim in the statement is that under Terry McAuliffe, there was a ""record investment in education.""

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on July 21, 2021, by Terry McAuliffe himself. This context suggests that the statement could be part of a political campaign or a reflection on past achievements, as Terry McAuliffe was likely discussing his previous tenure as Governor of Virginia.

## Step 3: Evaluate the need for fact-checking
To determine the accuracy of the statement, one would need to verify the education investment records during Terry McAuliffe's governorship. This involves checking budget allocations, education spending, and comparing these figures to previous years or other governors' tenures.

## Step 4: Assess the potential for bias
Given that the statement comes from Terry McAuliffe, there's a potential for bias, as he might highlight his achievements in a favorable light. However, this does not automatically make the statement false; it merely suggests the need for independent verification.

## Step 5: Determine the appropriate label based on available information
Without specific data or records to verify the claim of ""record investment in education"" during Terry McAuliffe's tenure, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as true or false based solely on the information provided. However, considering that the statement is about a specific, verifiable fact (education investment), and assuming it's made in a context where such records are available, the statement could potentially be verified through fact-checking.

## Step 6: Choose the most appropriate label given the constraints
Given the lack of specific evidence or context to directly verify the claim and considering the potential for the statement to be factual but unverified, the most cautious approach is to consider it as potentially true but in need of clarification or additional information for full verification.

The key claim is that before April 22, 2016, more than 18,000 individuals had their rights restored, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
Given that the statement was made on April 22, 2016, by Terry McAuliffe, it refers to actions taken during his governorship up to that point.

## Step 3: Evaluate the claim based on available information
Without specific data on the number of rights restorations by previous governors, it's challenging to verify the claim directly. However, the statement's specificity about the number (more than 18,000) and the comparison to previous governors suggests it could be based on factual data.

## Step 4: Consider the source of the statement
Terry McAuliffe, as the governor, would have access to the necessary data to make such a claim. His position suggests that the statement could be based on official records or data from his administration.

## Step 5: Determine the label based on the analysis
Given the lack of direct evidence to contradict the statement and considering the source, the statement seems to be based on factual information available to the governor. However, without direct access to the comparative data from previous governors, the statement's accuracy regarding the comparison cannot be fully verified.

The statement is about Obama's mid-term approval ratings in comparison to other presidents who went on to re-election, made by Tim Kaine on 1/2/2011.

## Step 2: Recall historical data on presidential approval ratings
Historically, presidents who have gone on to win re-election have had varying approval ratings at the mid-term point of their first term. For example, Ronald Reagan had a low approval rating during his mid-term but recovered and won re-election. Bill Clinton also faced challenges but managed to win re-election.

## Step 3: Consider Obama's mid-term approval ratings
As of January 2011, Obama's approval ratings were around 50%, which was considered relatively low compared to some of his predecessors at the same point in their presidencies.

## Step 4: Compare Obama's ratings to those of re-elected presidents
While some presidents like Reagan had lower ratings and still won re-election, others like Clinton had higher ratings. The statement that Obama's mid-term approval ratings are similar to other presidents who went on to re-election needs clarification because it depends on which specific presidents are being compared.

## Step 5: Evaluate the statement based on the criteria
Given the variability in mid-term approval ratings among presidents who went on to win re-election, the statement could be seen as partially accurate but lacking in specificity. It does not provide enough detail to fully support or refute the claim without considering the specific approval ratings of other presidents at their mid-term points.

mostly-false,Tim Kaine,"Says Donald Trump is ""against minimum wage.""",7/14/2016,speech,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/19/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-erroneously-says-donald-trump-against-mi/,mostly false,"## Step 1: Identify the statement and its components
The statement given is ""Says Donald Trump is 'against minimum wage.'"" This statement is attributed to Tim Kaine and was made on 7/14/2016.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available information
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to consider what was known about Donald Trump's stance on the minimum wage around the time the statement was made. In 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump's views on the minimum wage were somewhat nuanced. Initially, he suggested that the minimum wage was too high and could lead to job losses. However, he also indicated support for a higher minimum wage at certain points, suggesting a federal minimum wage increase to $10 or $15, though his stance was not consistently in favor of raising it.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement for accuracy
Given the complexity of Trump's statements on the minimum wage, labeling the statement as simply ""true"" or ""false"" might not fully capture the nuance. Trump did express opposition to raising the minimum wage at times, suggesting it could harm the economy or lead to job losses, but he also showed openness to the idea of increasing it under certain conditions.

## Step 4: Determine the appropriate label
Considering the nuances in Trump's stance on the minimum wage, the statement ""Says Donald Trump is 'against minimum wage'"" could be seen as an oversimplification. Trump's views were not consistently against the minimum wage; rather, they were variable and dependent on the context. Therefore, the statement might contain an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The statement claims that the tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen. To assess the truthfulness of this statement, we need to consider the tax policies and economic conditions during the tenures of both Tim Kaine and George Allen in Virginia.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
As of the statement's date (9/24/2012), we would need to look at the tax rates, economic conditions, and any notable tax policy changes that occurred during the governorships of both Tim Kaine (2006-2010) and George Allen (1994-1998) in Virginia.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement based on known facts and context
Without specific data on tax burdens during their respective terms, we must consider general trends and policies. However, given the nature of the statement and the lack of specific details provided within it, we must rely on the understanding that tax burdens can be influenced by numerous factors including state income tax rates, sales tax rates, and other forms of taxation.

## Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the statement
Given the information typically available and the complexity of calculating ""tax burden"" which can include various taxes and fees, the statement seems to require specific data to verify its accuracy. The statement does not provide enough context or data to definitively label it as true or false without further research into the economic and tax policies during the tenures of both governors.

## Step 5: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Tim Kaine himself, which might introduce a bias. Political figures often make claims that favor their own record or policies, so it's essential to verify such statements with independent data or fact-checking organizations.

## Step 6: Conclusion based on available information
Given the lack of specific data and the potential for bias from the source, the statement cannot be definitively classified as true or false without further investigation. However, considering the need for clarification and additional information to assess its accuracy, the most appropriate label would reflect the necessity for more context.

The statement claims that Georgians spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back from the federal government when it comes to transportation funds.

## Step 2: Consider the context and date of the statement
The statement was made on 3/7/2014 by Tom Graves. This date is important because it provides a snapshot of the situation at that time.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of data to support or refute the statement
To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we would need data on the amount Georgians paid in taxes related to transportation and the amount they received back from the federal government for the same purpose around the year 2014.

## Step 4: Consider the general trend of federal funding for transportation
Historically, many states have complained about not receiving back as much in federal transportation funding as they contribute through taxes. This is a common issue in U.S. politics, with some states feeling they are net contributors to the federal transportation fund.

## Step 5: Assess the statement without specific data
Without specific data from 2014 or around that time, it's challenging to definitively label the statement as true or false. However, the claim that states often feel they do not get back as much as they put in is a common narrative in discussions about federal funding.

## Step 6: Consider the source of the statement
The statement comes from Tom Graves, a political figure. Political statements can sometimes be biased or lack context to support a particular argument or agenda.

## Step 7: Determine the most appropriate label based on the information available
Given the lack of specific data to support or refute the claim and considering the context in which such statements are often made, the statement seems to reflect a common concern among states regarding federal funding. However, without concrete evidence from 2014, it's difficult to confirm its accuracy fully.

The statement claims that Tammy Baldwin supports a tax increase that President Obama says would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year. We need to verify if Tammy Baldwin indeed supports such a tax increase and if President Obama has stated that it would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year.

## Step 2: Consider the context and potential sources of information
Given the date of the statement (10/8/2012), we are looking at information that would have been relevant during the U.S. presidential and congressional election campaigns. It's crucial to find out if there were any tax proposals or discussions around that time that involved Tammy Baldwin and President Obama.

## Step 3: Evaluate the availability of evidence
Without direct access to specific policy proposals or statements from Tammy Baldwin and President Obama from that time, we must consider the nature of political campaigns and the common practice of candidates and their opponents making claims about each other's policies. It's possible that the statement is based on a misinterpretation, a lack of context, or a deliberate attempt to mislead.

## Step 4: Assess the statement based on the criteria
Given the lack of direct evidence provided in the statement and considering the context of political campaigns where misinformation or partial information is common, we must approach this statement with skepticism. The statement implies a direct link between Tammy Baldwin's support for a tax increase and President Obama's statement about its cost, which may not be entirely accurate or may be taken out of context.

## Step 5: Determine the label for the statement
Considering the potential for missing context, the possibility of selective information, and the nature of political discourse, the statement is likely to be misleading or incomplete. Without explicit evidence to support the claim that Tammy Baldwin supports a specific tax increase as described and that President Obama stated it would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year, the statement cannot be confirmed as entirely true.

The statement made by Tony Evers on 11/21/2019 claims that a Republican bill he vetoed would have implemented a mandate to make public the names of all students' parents or guardians.

## Step 2: Determine the context and potential implications
Understanding the context of the bill and its potential implications is crucial. If the bill indeed aimed to make public the names of all students' parents or guardians, it would raise significant privacy concerns.

## Step 3: Evaluate the available information
Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence or context about the specific bill in question, its content, or the reasoning behind Evers' veto. However, the claim specifically mentions a ""mandate"" to make public the names of all students' parents or guardians, which suggests a significant and potentially controversial policy change.

## Step 4: Consider the source and potential biases
The statement comes from Tony Evers, who, as the vetoing party, might have a perspective or bias against the bill. However, without more context or information about the bill's actual content, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of the statement purely based on the source.

## Step 5: Assess the statement's accuracy based on available information
Given the lack of specific details about the bill and its provisions, it's difficult to definitively label the statement as true or false. However, the statement is specific in its claim about the bill's intent, suggesting that if the bill indeed contained such a provision, Evers' statement could be seen as accurate.

## Step 6: Choose the appropriate label
Considering the information provided and the steps above, the most appropriate label for the statement, given the constraints and the need for additional context or clarification, would be ""mostly true"" if we assume the bill did contain such a provision. However, without explicit confirmation of the bill's content, this step requires acknowledging the potential for the statement to be accurate but also recognizing the need for more information.

The statement claims that current school lunch requirements cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches. This statement was made by Vicky Hartzler on August 14, 2018.

## Step 2: Consider the context and available data
As of the statement's date in 2018, there were discussions and studies about the impact of school lunch requirements on food waste and student participation. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 had introduced stricter nutrition standards for school meals, which some argued led to increased food waste and decreased student participation due to less palatable or unfamiliar food options.

## Step 3: Evaluate the statement's accuracy
Research and reports from around the time of the statement suggested that there were indeed issues with food waste and participation rates in school lunch programs following the implementation of stricter nutritional standards. However, the extent and causes of these issues could vary and were subject to ongoing debate and study.

## Step 4: Determine the label for the statement
Given the context and the information available up to 2018, the statement that current school lunch requirements cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches has a basis in reality, as there were reports and concerns about these issues.
