Barack Obama's statement that economists Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein have said that ""paying for Romney's tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000"" is mostly true. However, it needs some clarification.

Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein did indeed make such a statement in a 2012 op-ed in The New York Times. They wrote that ""Mr. Romney's tax plan would cost about $5 trillion over a decade, and the revenue shortfall would have to be made up by either cutting spending or raising taxes."" They went on to say that ""the largest tax increases would fall on families making between $100,000 and $200,000.""

However, it's important to note that the economists did not explicitly say that these tax increases would be the only way to pay for Romney's tax cuts. They also suggested that spending cuts could be part of the solution.

Barack Obama made the statement on January 27, 2010, during a speech about the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus package. The statement was made in the context of discussing the impact of the stimulus on employment.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is estimated to have increased employment by between 1.4 million and 3.3 million through the end of 2010. While the exact number of jobs saved or created is a matter of debate, it is widely accepted that the stimulus package had a positive impact on employment during the Great Recession.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that because of the steps taken in the stimulus package, there were about 2 million Americans working who might have otherwise been unemployed. However, it is important to note that this is an estimate and that the actual number could be higher or lower. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the stimulus package was not the only factor contributing to the employment recovery during this time period. Other factors, such as the natural recovery of the economy and monetary policy, also played a role.

The statement made by Barack Obama on 1/24/2009 that ""Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four"" is mostly true.

The statement is accurate in that the economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, but it needs clarification that the lost income for a family of four is an estimate based on that $1 trillion shortfall.

However, imports have since fluctuated and in recent years have been relatively stable, but still higher than in the late 1990s.

Barack Obama's statement that ""I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign. ... We've got about 60 percent done in three years"" is mostly true. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. During his 2008 campaign, Obama made numerous promises on various issues, including healthcare, education, energy, and the economy. While it's difficult to quantify exactly how much progress has been made on each promise, it's clear that significant progress has been made on many fronts. For example, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was passed in 2010, providing healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus package, helped to prevent a deeper economic downturn and create jobs. However, it's important to note that not all of Obama's promises have been fully realized, and some, like the closure of Guantanamo Bay, have faced significant challenges.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus bill, included provisions for tax cuts for individuals and small businesses. The Making Work Pay tax credit, which provided up to $400 for individuals and $800 for married couples, was a significant part of this tax relief. Additionally, the Act provided tax incentives for small businesses to hire new employees and expand their businesses.

However, it is important to note that the statement could be more specific about which tax cuts Obama is referring to and when they were implemented.

Explanation:
Barack Obama's statement that ""Romney ""would turn Medicare into a voucher program"" is mostly true. Mitt Romney had indeed proposed turning Medicare into a voucher-like system during his 2012 presidential campaign. Under Romney's plan, Medicare beneficiaries would have received a fixed amount of money to purchase health insurance coverage from private insurers. This is different from the traditional Medicare program, where the government pays for a wide range of healthcare services for beneficiaries.

However, it's important to note that Obama's statement could be considered mostly true with some clarification. While Romney did propose turning Medicare into a voucher-like system, it's worth noting that the specifics of his plan and its potential impact on beneficiaries were subject to debate and analysis. For example, some estimates suggested that Romney's plan could result in higher out-of-pocket costs for some Medicare beneficiaries, while others argued that it could lead to greater competition and innovation in the healthcare market.

Therefore, it is not possible to label this statement as true, false, or any of the other labels based on the given criteria. Instead, we can evaluate the accuracy of the Obama tax calculator itself.

The Obama tax calculator was a tool created by the Obama for America campaign during the 2008 presidential election to help voters estimate their potential tax savings under Barack Obama's tax plan. The calculator was based on the tax proposals outlined in Obama's campaign platform and was intended to provide an estimate of how much a taxpayer might save under Obama's plan, based on their income and filing status.

There have been no credible reports of significant errors or inaccuracies in the Obama tax calculator. However, it is important to note that the calculator was designed to provide an estimate based on the tax proposals at the time, and that actual tax laws and regulations could differ once Obama was elected and implemented his tax plan. Additionally, the calculator did not take into account certain complex tax situations or deductions, and was intended to be a general guide rather than a definitive tool for determining individual tax liability.

Therefore, while the Obama tax calculator was generally accurate based on the information available at the time, it is important to note that it was not a definitive tool for determining individual tax liability, and that actual tax laws and regulations could differ once Obama was elected and implemented his tax plan.

This trend has continued into 2016 and beyond.

However, it's important to note that the cost of natural gas, which is also a significant source of electricity in Texas, has also been decreasing and is currently cheaper than wind power in many cases. Therefore, while wind power may be cheaper than coal in Texas, it's not always the cheapest option overall.

Explanation:
The statement made by Barack Obama on 4/18/2008 that ""More people without health care since George Bush took office; more children in poverty since George Bush took office"" is mostly false. While it is true that during George W. Bush's presidency, the number of uninsured Americans increased and the number of children living in poverty also rose, it is important to note that these trends began before Bush took office and continued after he left.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of uninsured Americans had been increasing since the late 1990s and reached a peak in 2009, the year after Bush left office. Similarly, the number of children living in poverty had been increasing since the late 1990s and continued to rise after Bush left office.

Therefore, while it is true that the situation worsened during Bush's presidency, it is not accurate to say that more people became uninsured or more children lived in poverty solely due to Bush's policies. Other factors, such as the economy and demographic changes, also played a role.

Barack Obama's statement that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is helping to slow the growth of Medicare's health care costs is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. According to various studies and reports, the ACA has contributed to a slowdown in the growth of Medicare spending. For instance, a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2012 found that the ACA would reduce Medicare spending by about $350 billion over ten years. Another report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2013 found that Medicare spending grew at a slower rate in 2012 compared to previous years, and the ACA was one of the factors contributing to this trend. However, it's important to note that the ACA's impact on Medicare spending is just one factor among many, and other factors such as demographic changes, technological advances, and economic conditions also play a role in Medicare spending trends. Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it would be more accurate to say that the ACA is contributing to a slower growth in Medicare spending, rather than explicitly stating that it is ""helping to slow the growth"" without qualification.",D,health,>100000

Ukraine was indeed a nuclear-armed state from 1991 to 1994, when it possessed the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. However, Ben Carson's statement that Ukraine gave away their nuclear arms ""with the understanding that we would protect them"" is misleading. The protection was not explicitly promised by the United States, but rather implied through the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, which was signed by the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom in 1994. The memorandum pledged to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. The United States did provide some security assistance to Ukraine after the country gave up its nuclear arsenal, but it was not a formal protection pact.

The statement that ""In 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees.

According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. ranked 11th in 2013 in terms of the percentage of 25-34 year olds with tertiary education (college or higher). This ranking is not significantly different from the one in 1990, and it is misleading to suggest that the U.S. has dropped to 12th place.

Bernie Sanders' statement that ""in 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income"" is generally accurate, as reported by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) in a 2008 report titled ""Income Inequality: Trends and Policy Issues."" According to the CRS report, the top 1 percent of income earners in the United States received 23.5 percent of all income in 2007.

However, Sanders' statement also includes the claim that ""which is more than the entire bottom 50 percent,"" which requires some clarification. The CRS report does not provide a clear figure for the percentage of income earned by the bottom 50 percent in 2007. However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the bottom 50 percent of income earners received approximately 12.3 percent of all income in 2006. While the exact figure for 2007 may be slightly different, it is clear that the top 1 percent earned a larger share of income than the bottom 50 percent.

Explanation:
Bernie Sanders' statement that ""very little of (the defense) budget less than 10 percent actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism"" is mostly false. According to the Congressional Research Service, the Department of Defense (DoD) spent about 8.5 percent of its budget on operations related to countering terrorism in fiscal year 2015. This percentage increased to about 11 percent in fiscal year 2016, and the DoD requested about 13.6 percent for fiscal year 2017. While Sanders' statement is not entirely accurate, it is not as far off as the label of false would imply. The statement needs some clarification, as it does not specify which fiscal year the budget figures refer to, and Sanders may have been rounding down when he said ""less than 10 percent."" However, the statement is not implausible, as some media outlets and think tanks have suggested that as little as 5 percent of the defense budget goes to counter-terrorism efforts. Overall, Sanders' statement is mostly false, but it is worth noting that the exact percentage of the defense budget dedicated to counter-terrorism efforts is a matter of some debate.",D,war,>100000

Explanation:
Bernie Sanders' statement that ""significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to fight international terrorism"" is mostly false. According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. military budget for fiscal year 2015 allocated about 8.5 percent of its discretionary budget to the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), which includes funding for counterterrorism efforts. However, it is important to note that the military budget is not the only source of funding for counterterrorism efforts. Other departments and agencies, such as the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security, also receive significant funding for counterterrorism activities. Therefore, while Sanders' statement is not entirely false, it is misleading as it only considers the military budget and ignores other sources of funding for counterterrorism efforts.",D,war,>100000

Explanation:
Bernie Sanders' statement that ""The top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent"" is mostly true. According to a 2016 report by the Economic Policy Institute, the top 0.1% of Americans owned about 39% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 90% owned about 27%. This means that the top 0.1% had more wealth than the bottom 90% combined, but not quite as much as Sanders' statement implies. However, the trend towards increasing wealth inequality has continued since then, and more recent data suggests that the top 0.1% now own a larger share of the wealth than they did in 2016. Therefore, Sanders' statement is mostly true, as it accurately reflects the trend towards increasing wealth inequality in the United States, even if the exact figures have changed slightly since the statement was made.",D,economy,>100000

According to a report by Mental Health America, Texas ranked 50th in the country for overall mental health care access in 2022. However, it's important to note that this ranking is based on a variety of factors, including the number of adults with mental illness who receive treatment, the availability of mental health professionals, and the affordability of mental health care. Therefore, while the statement is mostly true in terms of the ranking itself, it may not fully capture the complexity of mental health care access in Texas and other states.

The statement that ""Nobody's ever said it"" on Fox News that you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance is partially accurate but omits important details. While it is true that no one on Fox News has explicitly stated that you will go to jail for not buying health insurance, some Fox News personalities have made controversial comments about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the potential consequences for not complying with its requirements.

For instance, in 2013, Sean Hannity suggested that people could move to another state if they didn't like the ACA, implying that not complying with the law could be an option. He said, ""If you don't like it, move. I'm going to move. I'm going to move to another state where they don't have it."" While Hannity did not say that people would go to jail for not buying health insurance, his comments could be interpreted as encouraging non-compliance with the law.

Additionally, in 2014, Bill O'Reilly himself discussed the possibility of fines for not buying health insurance, but he did not mention jail time. He said, ""The IRS can fine you up to $2,500 a year if you don't buy health insurance. That's a lot of money for a lot of people.""

Therefore, while no one on Fox News has explicitly stated that you will go to jail for not buying health insurance, some personalities have made comments that could be interpreted as encouraging non-compliance with the ACA or discussing potential consequences for not complying, such as fines.

The violent crime rate in Florida was 758.3 per 100,000 residents in 1995 and 752.3 per 100,000 residents in 1996.

According to the New Jersey Department of Education, the graduation rate for Newark Public Schools was 68.1% for the 2010-2011 school year, which is the year Christie's statement refers to.

Private-sector job growth in New Jersey in 2011 did indeed place the state in the top third among all states, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, it's important to note that this ranking is based on the percentage increase in private-sector employment from the previous year. Therefore, the statement needs some clarification to avoid any potential confusion.

Here's a breakdown of the data:

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, New Jersey had a 1.6% increase in private-sector employment in 2011. This placed the state in the 11th position among all states in terms of percentage growth. However, when looking at the actual number of private-sector jobs added, New Jersey ranked 7th with a total increase of 52,200 jobs.

Given that the statement was made by Chris Christie and the date was 2/21/2012, it's reasonable to assume that he was referring to the ranking based on the number of jobs added, as that would have been the most recent data available at the time.

Instead, it limits the ability of veterans to sue the manufacturers of certain products containing toxic substances, such as Agent Orange, for damages related to their cancers. The bill does not affect veterans' eligibility for medical benefits or their ability to recover medical costs from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but omits important details and takes things out of context.

Additionally, it is important to note that Romney served as governor from 2003 to 2007, and the job growth numbers refer to the entire period from 2003 to 2010. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate when it says ""When Mitt Romney was governor,"" as the job growth numbers include years before and after Romney's tenure as governor.

Explanation:

David Dewhurst's statement that ""You've got almost twice as many cops in New York City as you do on our entire border. That's nuts"" is partially accurate but omits important details. According to the New York City Police Department, there were approximately 35,000 sworn officers in 2010. The total number of law enforcement officers along the southwest border of the United States, as reported by the Department of Homeland Security, was around 21,000 in 2010. This means that there were approximately twice as many officers in New York City as on the border. However, it's important to note that the functions and responsibilities of these officers are vastly different. New York City police officers primarily deal with local law enforcement and crime prevention, while border patrol agents focus on securing the border and preventing illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, data from the first quarter of 2015 shows that Mexico was the fifth largest destination for U.S. exports, with $23.3 billion in goods shipped. However, the statement made by Donald Trump on August 19, 2015, implies that U.S. companies are moving into Mexico more than any other place, which is not supported by the data.

This statement can be labeled as ""mostly true"" with the following explanation:

Donald Trump's statement that Hillary Clinton ""promised, running for the Senate years ago, 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. ... Not only didn't they come, but they lost so many jobs"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification.

Clinton did indeed make a promise to create 200,000 jobs in upstate New York during her 2000 Senate campaign. However, it's important to note that job creation is a complex process that can't be attributed to a single individual or event. The number of jobs in a region can be influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, industry trends, and government policies.

According to a fact check by PolitiFact, Clinton's campaign did not deliver on its promise to create 200,000 jobs in upstate New York during her first term in the Senate. However, the number of jobs in the region did increase during her tenure, but not by the promised amount. Additionally, some jobs were lost during that period as well.

Therefore, while Trump's statement that ""they lost so many jobs"" is accurate, it's important to note that job creation and loss are ongoing processes that can't be attributed solely to Clinton's campaign promise.

However, it is important to note that this statement requires some clarification. While the statement is accurate, it does not provide enough context to fully understand the significance of this record high. For example, it is important to note that while Hispanic household income has been increasing, it still lags behind the median household income for non-Hispanic whites, which was $61,372 in 2017. Additionally, it is important to consider the factors that have contributed to this increase in income, such as changes in the labor market, immigration patterns, and demographic shifts.

This is significantly lower than the one in three figure stated by Trump.

The Secure Communities Program and 287(g) immigration programs were initiated under the George W. Bush administration in 2008 and 2006, respectively. The Secure Communities Program was a federal-local partnership that allowed local law enforcement agencies to share information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) about individuals in their custody who were suspected of being in the country illegally. The 287(g) program, on the other hand, allowed state and local law enforcement agencies to perform the functions of immigration officers within their jurisdictions.

The Obama administration did make some changes to these programs. In 2014, the Secure Communities Program was replaced with the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which focused on removing undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of certain crimes or posed a threat to public safety. The 287(g) program, however, was not abolished but rather underwent some modifications to increase oversight and training requirements for participating law enforcement agencies.

Donald Trump's statement that these programs were ""recklessly gutted"" by the Obama administration is an exaggeration.

Explanation:

Donald Trump's statement that ""They never thought ... that I was going to release that call and I really had no choice because Adam Schiff made up a call"" is mostly false.

The context of the statement refers to the release of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which was at the center of an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives. Trump's claim that Schiff made up a call is not supported by facts. Schiff, a Democratic congressman, had paraphrased parts of the call during a congressional hearing, but he did not fabricate the content.

The statement made by Donald Trump on 3/7/2017 that ""122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield"" is mostly false.

The organization found that as of 2016, only 12 former detainees have been confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorist activities. This is significantly lower than the 122 that Trump stated.

Additionally, it is important to note that the Obama Administration transferred a total of 242 detainees from Guantanamo during its tenure. This means that only about 5% of those released have returned to the battlefield.

The statement made by Donald Trump on 6/30/2019 that ""We hadnt had a (car) plant built in years  in decades, actually. And now we have many plants being built all throughout the United States"" is mostly true.

While it is true that the number of car plants being built in the US has increased in recent years, it is important to note that there were still car plants being built during the decades prior to this increase.

In 2016, Toyota announced plans to invest $10 billion in the US over the next five years, including the construction of a new plant in Guanajuato, Mexico, but also expanding its existing plants in the US.

The primary motivation for Social Security was to provide a safety net for the elderly and reduce poverty among older Americans. The idea for a social insurance program to address the economic needs of the elderly had been gaining momentum for decades before the Social Security Act was passed in 1935.

The statement made by Gwen Moore that ""Says Dontre Hamilton 'was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee'"" is mostly false. While it is true that Dontre Hamilton was shot 14 times by a police officer in Milwaukee, the implication that he was shot solely for resting on a park bench is not accurate.

According to reports from the Milwaukee Police Department and witness statements, Hamilton was behaving erratically and ignoring officers' commands to put his hands behind his back before the shooting occurred. The officer who shot Hamilton, Christopher Manney, claimed that Hamilton had reached for his baton during a pat-down search, leading him to fear for his safety and use deadly force.

Explanation:

Hillary Clinton's statement that ""By the time I left"" the State Department, ""economic growth was up and opium production was down"" in Afghanistan, while ""infant mortality declined"" and school enrollment rose by more than sevenfold,"" is mostly true. However, it requires some clarification.

According to the World Bank, Afghanistan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate was 3.1% in 2012, the last year Clinton served as Secretary of State. While this was an improvement from the negative growth rates experienced in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was still relatively low compared to other countries in the region.

Regarding opium production, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported that opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan decreased by 36% between 2011 and 2012, the year Clinton left the State Department. This was a significant reduction, but it is important to note that opium production remained at historically high levels, and has since increased again.

Infant mortality in Afghanistan did decline during Clinton's tenure at the State Department. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the infant mortality rate in Afghanistan dropped from 129 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2009 to 101 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013.

School enrollment in Afghanistan also increased significantly during this period. According to UNESCO, primary school enrollment rose from 2.5 million in 2002 to 8.5 million in 2013. This represents an increase of more than sevenfold, as Clinton claimed.

However, it is important to note that progress in Afghanistan was not solely due to Clinton's efforts at the State Department. The international community, including the United States, has invested significant resources in Afghanistan's development since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001. Additionally, the security situation in Afghanistan has remained volatile, and progress in some areas has been reversed in recent years",D,economy,>100000

Hillary Clinton did make the statement that her health care plan would cost $110 billion in the first year during a debate on September 17, 2007. However, she did not specify how the costs would be paid for in her statement. It was later clarified in her campaign that she intended to pay for the plan with savings from various sources, such as administrative efficiencies and reducing military spending on Iraq.

Hillary Clinton's statement that ""Our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification.

In the first quarter of 2016, small donations accounted for about 60% of her campaign's total receipts.

Explanation:
President Trump was indeed criticized for not making a public statement regarding alleged Russian bounties on American troops in Afghanistan.

In fact, Trump was asked about the issue during a press conference on July 15, 2020, and he denied any knowledge of the bounties.

It is important to note that lawfully owned guns are not ""committing crimes,"" and it is not uncommon for guns used in crimes to be obtained from various sources, including other states and even other countries.

The statement implies that Bush won a majority of Hispanic votes statewide, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, Bush only won the election by a narrow margin, and his victory was due in large part to his strong performance among Hispanic voters in certain key counties, particularly Miami-Dade.

Explanation:

Jeb Bush's statement that the national debt ""hasn't been brought up"" in debates is partially accurate but omits important details. While it's true that the debt was not a major topic during the 2016 Republican primary debates, it was still discussed to some extent. For instance, during the third debate on December 15, 2015, moderator Chris Wallace asked candidates about their plans to address the debt. Bush himself mentioned the debt during the debate, stating that he would eliminate three federal Cabinet departments to help reduce the deficit.

Therefore, while the debt was not a dominant issue in the debates, it was still discussed to some extent. Bush's statement is partially accurate but lacks the full context of the debate discussions.",R,economy,50000-100000

Affirmative action in Florida was eliminated in 2000, and since then, the percentage of African American and Hispanic students in the university system has not consistently increased. In fact, according to a report by the Florida Board of Governors, the percentage of African American students in the state university system decreased from 13.2 percent in 2000 to 12.3 percent in 2014. The percentage of Hispanic students increased slightly from 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent during the same period. However, it is important to note that other factors, such as demographic changes and economic conditions, have also influenced enrollment trends.

Therefore, Jeb Bush's statement is mostly false because it oversimplifies the complex issue of affirmative action and its impact on college enrollment. While it is true that some universities have seen an increase in minority enrollment since the elimination of affirmative action, the trend is not consistent across the board, and other factors must be considered.",R,race,50000-100000

However, this period only covers the first three years of Barack Obama's presidency.

Kendrick Meek's statement that Jeff Greene is the ""king of the undercover Credit Default Swap"" requires clarification.

The statement omits important context and takes things out of context.

Credit default swaps are financial instruments that allow investors to protect themselves against the risk of default by a borrower. They were widely used in the housing market leading up to the financial crisis of 2008. Jeff Greene was a prominent investor in credit default swaps and made significant profits from them. However, it is important to note that many other financial institutions and individuals were also heavily involved in the credit default swap market and contributed to the financial crisis.

Maggie Hassan's statement that Kelly Ayotte ""has voted to defund Planned Parenthood"" six times is mostly true. Ayotte, a former Senator from New Hampshire, did indeed vote six times to defund Planned Parenthood, according to various news reports and voting records. However, it's important to note that the context and implications of these votes may vary, and some of them were part of larger budget or appropriations bills. Therefore, the statement could benefit from additional context or clarification.

Label: half true

Explanation:
Marco Rubio's statement that ""From now on, we have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station"" is partially accurate but omits important details. The statement is based on the fact that after the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the United States had to rely on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft to send its astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). However, the cost of a seat on a Soyuz spacecraft is not a flat rate of $50 million per astronaut. Instead, NASA pays Russia about $70 million per seat, which can accommodate one American and one Russian astronaut. Therefore, the cost per American astronaut is approximately $35 million. Rubio's statement is an exaggeration of the actual cost, but it is not entirely false.",R,economy,>100000

Marco Rubio's statement that ""There is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification.

However, it is important to note that there have been ongoing debates and proposals to make changes to the Medicaid program, which could potentially result in some people losing their benefits in the future. For example, the American Health Care Act, which was proposed by Republicans in 2017, included provisions that would have led to Medicaid funding being reduced over time, which could have resulted in some people losing their coverage. However, the bill ultimately failed to pass.

The New York bike path attack, which occurred on October 31, 2017, was the ninth vehicle attack, but it was not clear at the time if it was definitively linked to ISIS. The investigation was ongoing, and the attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, was later charged with terrorism-related crimes, but there was no definitive evidence that he was directly connected to ISIS.

However, it is important to note that the Bachmanns have received significant financial benefits from the farm through other means, such as tax deductions and subsidies. According to federal records, the Bachmann family farm received over $250,000 in farm subsidies between 1995 and 2006.

However, they have since applied for and been granted asylum, which is a legal process that allows individuals to remain in the country if they can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country.

Therefore, the statement made by Mike DeWine is significantly lower than the stated percentage. Additionally, the statement lacks context and may be intended to create a strong emotional response, which is a common tactic used in political debates. However, it is important to note that the percentage of Down Syndrome pregnancies that end in abortion is a complex issue, and there are many factors that contribute to this decision, including the availability of prenatal testing, societal attitudes towards people with disabilities, and personal beliefs.

Under the Obama administration, utility bills have indeed risen for many Americans. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential electricity prices have increased by an average of 1.3% per year between 2008 and 2016. Natural gas prices have also risen during this period, leading to higher bills for those who heat their homes with natural gas. However, it's important to note that utility prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, regulatory decisions, and infrastructure investments. The Obama economy did not cause utility price increases in isolation, but it is one contributing factor.

Mitt Romney's statement is mostly true because it accurately reflects the trend of rising utility bills during the Obama administration, but it does not provide a complete explanation for the cause of these increases. It's also worth noting that utility prices have continued to rise under the Trump administration, so this issue is not unique to the Obama years.",R,economy,>100000

According to data from Statistics Canada and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Canada did indeed add more jobs in January 2011 than the United States did. However, it's important to note that the two countries have different labor force sizes and employment rates, so comparing raw job numbers without context can be misleading.

Mitt Romney's statement that under President John F. Kennedy, the government took up 27 percent of the economy, and today it consumes 37 percent, is mostly true. However, it needs some clarification.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that was consumed by federal, state, and local governments in 1960 was 26.2 percent. In 2011, the percentage was 35.5 percent. So, Romney's statement is mostly true, but it's important to note that the percentage of GDP consumed by government has increased more than he stated.

The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, does put the federal government in a role between individuals and their doctors in several ways. For instance, the law establishes health insurance marketplaces where individuals can purchase plans, and the government provides subsidies for eligible individuals to help pay for premiums. Additionally, Obamacare sets minimum essential coverage requirements and mandates that individuals have health insurance or face penalties.

However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide a complete picture. The federal government's role in Obamacare is not solely about putting itself between individuals and their doctors; it also aims to expand access to healthcare and make it more affordable for millions of Americans.

At the time of Mitt Romney's statement on February 8, 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the total labor force was approximately 154.2 million people, with 133.4 million employed and 10.8 million unemployed. This means that there were 10.8 million people who were unemployed and actively looking for work.

However, the statement does not account for those who have given up looking for work and are no longer considered part of the labor force. According to the same BLS report, there were 2.5 million people who were marginally attached to the labor force, meaning they wanted and were available for work, but had not searched for a job in the past month. Additionally, there were 873,000 people who were considered to be employed but wanted to work more hours.

So, while it is true that there were 13.1 million people (10.8 million unemployed + 2.3 million marginally attached) who were not employed and either actively looking for work or wanted to work more hours, it is not accurate to say that ""25 or 24 million people"" were ""out of work or stopped looking for work."" The true number is closer to 13.1 million, and it is important to note that some of these individuals were actively seeking employment.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false because it exaggerates the number of people who are completely detached from the labor force and ignores the fact that some of those who are not employed are still actively seeking work.",R,economy,>100000

The proposed coronavirus relief bill, as of June 2020, was estimated to cost around $1 trillion.

Nathan Deal, the Governor of Georgia, stated that since he took office, over 319,000 new private sector jobs have been created in Georgia with nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months.

To fact check this statement, we can look at the data from the Georgia Department of Labor. According to their data, from January 2011 to December 2014, the private sector added a total of 268,200 jobs. From December 2013 to December 2014, the private sector added 58,300 jobs.

This statement by Paul Broun can be fact-checked by looking at the records of both him and Dr. Gingrey regarding their support and proposals for budget cuts.

According to the Congressional Record, Paul Broun has indeed proposed and supported budget cuts totaling $155 billion over the last two years. For instance, on March 14, 2011, he introduced H.R. 1, which aimed to reduce federal spending by $61 billion in 2011 and $5.3 trillion over ten years. Similarly, on March 29, 2013, he voted for H.J.

Regarding Dr. Gingrey, a search of the Congressional Record does not yield any clear evidence of him proposing or supporting budget cuts totaling $155 billion over the last two years.

Based on the available information, the statement by Paul Broun can be labeled as ""mostly true.""

Paul Ryan's statement that ""We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws"" is mostly true. However, it requires some clarification.

The term ""trapped cash"" refers to the earnings that American companies have accumulated abroad and are unable to bring back to the United States without facing high taxes. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, as of 2016, the estimated amount of earnings held by U.S. multinational corporations abroad was around $2.6 trillion. This is significantly less than the $3 trillion figure cited by Paul Ryan, but it is still a large sum of money.

The reason why these earnings are ""trapped"" is because of the U.S. tax code, which imposes a high tax rate on repatriated earnings. The current tax rate is 35%, although some companies are able to reduce their tax liability through various tax incentives and deductions. In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which included a one-time tax holiday on repatriated earnings, allowing companies to bring back their foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate of 15.5% for cash and cash equivalents and 8% for illiquid assets. This tax holiday was intended to encourage companies to bring back their earnings and invest in the U.S. economy.

Therefore, Paul Ryan's statement is mostly true, but it is important to note that the exact amount of ""trapped cash"" is around $2.6 trillion, and the tax laws have since been changed to allow for a repatriation tax holiday.",R,economy,>100000

Label: mostly false.

Explanation:

Paul Ryan's statement that ""if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent"" is mostly false. While it is true that the labor force participation rate has decreased since Obama took office, it is not accurate to say that unemployment would be 11 percent if the participation rate were the same. The relationship between the two is more complex than that.

The labor force participation rate measures the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively looking for work. A decrease in the participation rate can be caused by a number of factors, including retirement, disability, or discouragement (people who have given up looking for work). A decrease in participation does not necessarily mean that there are 11 percent more unemployed people than there actually are. In fact, the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate are two separate statistics that measure different aspects of the labor market.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent when Obama took office in January 2009, and it has since decreased to 4.4 percent as of May 2022. The labor force participation rate, on the other hand, was 65.7 percent in January 2009 and has since decreased to 62.2 percent as of May 2022. If we assume that the participation rate had remained at its January 2009 level, the unemployment rate would have been lower, but it would not have been 11 percent.

Therefore, Paul Ryan's statement is mostly false because it oversimplifies the relationship between the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate, and it ignores the fact that the two are separate statistics.",R,economy,>100000

Explanation:

Senator Richard Durbin's statement that Jeff Sessions had objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in the armed forces, implying that Sessions had made a comparison between immigrants from Cullman, Alabama, and Kenya, is partially accurate but omits important context.

Sessions did indeed make such a comparison during a hearing on immigration policy in 1996. However, the full context of his statement shows that he was not objecting to immigrants serving in the military, but rather expressing concern about national security and the potential for espionage. Sessions stated, ""I rise today to challenge the premise underlying the bill that illegal immigrants are more likely to be good soldiers than good citizens."" He then went on to say, ""In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?""

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas did indeed have the highest job growth rate in 2010, with a net gain of 172,300 jobs. However, it's important to note that this statement could be more accurately described as ""Texas had the highest percentage increase in employment in 2010,"" as some states with larger populations may have added more raw numbers of jobs but had smaller percentage increases. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the economic recovery from the Great Recession was uneven across the country, and Texas' strong job growth was due in part to its oil and gas industry, which was less affected by the recession than other sectors.",R,economy,10000-50000

Rick Santorum's statement that ""the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers"" is partially accurate but omits important details. In his 2011 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama did propose limiting the charitable deduction for higher-income taxpayers, but only for deductions above 2% of adjusted gross income.

The statement made by Rick Santorum on 1/4/2012 that ""poverty levels went down to the lowest level ever for ... African-American children"" as a result of welfare reform is mostly false. While it is true that poverty levels among African-American children have decreased since the implementation of welfare reform, they were not at an all-time low in 2012. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate for African-American children was 35.6% in 1993, the year before welfare reform was signed into law, and had decreased to 31.2% by 2012. However, this was not the lowest poverty rate on record for African-American children. The poverty rate for African-American children was lower in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before reliable data was available. Therefore, Santorum's statement was misleading and lacked important context.",R,race,10000-50000

The statement made by Rick Scott that ""A company with '20 employees' could go 'out of business' because of health care law requirements to buy insurance"" is mostly true, but it needs some clarification. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does impose a requirement on employers with more than 50 full-time employees to offer health insurance coverage or face penalties. However, the penalty for not providing coverage is typically less than the cost of providing coverage for all employees, and many small businesses are able to provide coverage through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchange.

The statement made by Rick Scott that ""We are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years"" is partially accurate but omits important details. The statement is based on Florida's job creation goal set by Governor Rick Scott in 2010. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, as of May 2013, Florida had created 328,000 private sector jobs since January 2011, which is about half of the 700,000 goal. However, the statement does not mention that the goal was for seven years starting from 2010, and it only mentions the number of jobs created since January 2011.

Explanation:
The statement made by Rick Scott that ""The Paris Climate Agreement is 'bad for America,' because it 'does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable'"" is mostly false.

The Paris Climate Agreement does include provisions for holding countries accountable for their greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement sets targets for reducing emissions and requires regular reporting and transparency from each country. It also includes a mechanism for addressing ""non-compliance"" by countries that are not meeting their targets.

While it is true that China and India are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, and their emissions have been growing rapidly, the Paris Agreement does include provisions for addressing this issue. For example, the agreement includes a ""ratcheting up"" mechanism that allows for increasing emissions reduction targets over time, which could help address the issue of large emitters like China and India.

Therefore, the statement made by Rick Scott is mostly false, as it ignores the fact that the Paris Climate Agreement does include provisions for holding countries accountable for their emissions, including large emitters like China and India.",R,environment,10000-50000

The statement made by Rick Scott that ""For the first time ever, we completely funded the critical needs waiting list so persons with unique abilities can get the help they need"" is mostly true. However, it requires some clarification.

According to news reports, the statement was made in reference to the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council (FDDC), which oversees the waiting list for people with developmental disabilities who need services. The FDDC announced in January 2016 that they had received enough funding to eliminate the waiting list for the first time in history.

However, it's important to note that the funding came from a combination of sources, including state and federal funds, as well as private donations. The statement does not explicitly mention this, but it is an important context to consider when evaluating the accuracy of the claim.

According to a fact check by PolitiFact, Portman's statement was mostly true. The analysis showed that between 2001 and 2009, Ohio lost about 265,000 manufacturing jobs, and about 245,000 of those jobs went to other states. The remaining jobs were lost to other industries or were offshored to other countries.

The statement that ""There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), as of 2019, the solar industry employed about 373,802 people in the United States, while the coal mining industry employed about 50,800 people. Therefore, the solar industry does indeed employ more people than the coal mining industry.

However, it's important to note that the solar industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, while the coal mining industry has been declining. This means that the difference in employment numbers between the two industries has been growing larger over time. For example, in 2010, there were about 86,000 jobs in the solar industry and 87,000 jobs in coal mining. So, while the statement is mostly true in 2014 when it was made, it is even more true today.

The source of the statement is Sheldon Whitehouse, a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island who has been a vocal advocate for renewable energy and a critic of the coal industry. The statement was made during a speech on the Senate floor on May 27, 2014.

The CDC has not been banned from using the word ""transgender"" by the Trump administration. However, there have been reports of the administration considering such a ban, but it has not been officially implemented. Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but omits important details.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

The statement made by Tammy Baldwin on June 26, 2018, that ""Says the Trump administration 'has banned the CDC even using the word transgender'"" is mostly false. While there have been reports of the Trump administration considering a ban on the use of the term ""transgender"" in certain federal documents and programs, there is no evidence that such a ban has been officially implemented for the CDC as of now.

According to a report by The New York Times published on March 22, 2018, the Trump administration was considering removing references to transgender people in various federal documents and programs. The report stated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, was among the departments considering such changes. However, it is important to note that this was a proposed change and had not been officially implemented at the time of Baldwin's statement.

Therefore, while there is some truth to the statement that the Trump administration has considered a ban on the use of the term ""transgender"" in federal agencies, the statement is mostly false because it implies that such a ban has already been implemented for the CDC, which is not the case.",D,transparency,10000-50000

Explanation:
Tammy Baldwin's statement that ""every other major party nominee"" for the past 40 years has released their tax returns, except for Donald Trump, is mostly true. However, it requires some clarification.

The statement is accurate in that most major party nominees have released their tax returns in the past 40 years. However, it is important to note that there have been some exceptions. For example, Dwight D. Eisenhower did not release his tax returns during his presidency, and Richard Nixon released only a summary of his tax returns during his campaign in 1968.

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it would be more accurate to say that ""most"" major party nominees have released their tax returns in the past 40 years, rather than ""every other"" nominee.

Terry McAuliffe's statement that ""there was a record investment in education"" under his governorship is mostly true, but it requires some clarification. According to data from the National Association of State Budget Officers, Virginia did indeed have the largest percentage increase in education spending among all states between fiscal years 2010 and 2014, with an increase of 21.2%. However, it's important to note that this increase occurred during a period of economic recovery following the Great Recession, and education spending had been decreasing prior to that. Additionally, McAuliffe's tenure as governor only began in 2014, so the record investment he is referring to likely refers to the entire period from 2010 to 2014, during which he served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and played a role in shaping the party's platform and messaging on education issues.",D,education,10000-50000

The statement implies that this number is more than what the past seven governors combined achieved in their four-year terms. While it is true that McAuliffe has restored more rights than any of his predecessors, it is important to note that the time frame for comparison is not explicitly stated in the statement.

President Obama's mid-term approval ratings were indeed similar to those of other presidents who went on to re-election. However, it's important to note that approval ratings alone do not guarantee re-election, and other factors such as the economy, public sentiment, and political circumstances also play a significant role.

Tim Kaine, who made the statement, was the chairman of the Democratic National Committee at the time and was speaking in support of President Obama's re-election campaign. The statement was made during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program on January 2, 2011.

According to Gallup polling data, President Obama's approval rating at that time was 46%, which was similar to the approval ratings of other presidents at the same point in their terms. For example, President Clinton's approval rating was 48% in January 1998, and President Reagan's was 45% in January 1986.

However, it's worth noting that approval ratings can fluctuate significantly over time, and President Obama's ratings did improve somewhat in the years leading up to his re-election in 2012. Additionally, other factors such as the economy and public sentiment played a significant role in his re-election.

Therefore, while the statement is mostly true in the sense that President Obama's mid-term approval ratings were similar to those of other presidents who went on to re-election, it's important to remember that approval ratings alone do not guarantee re-election, and other factors also play a role.",D,transparency,50000-100000

Donald Trump has indeed expressed skepticism about the minimum wage and has suggested that it could be detrimental to employment in some cases. For example, in a 2015 interview with CNN, he said, ""I think there's something wrong when you're making $35,000 or $40,000 a year, and you're paying for healthcare that's really expensive. And you're paying for education that's not good. You're paying for education that's very poor."" He went on to say, ""I think it's a very complex subject. I'm not saying the minimum wage should be lowered, but I think it's something that has to be looked at very seriously.""

However, it's important to note that Trump's position on the minimum wage is not entirely consistent, and he has also expressed support for raising it in certain circumstances. For example, in a 2015 interview with Fox News, he said, ""I'd rather leave it the way it is. Somebody has to help these people. They have no money. They're living in poverty. And I will tell you, the Republicans are going to have to do something. They're going to have to help these people.""

So while it's true that Trump has expressed skepticism about the minimum wage, it's also true that he has not taken a definitive stance against it. Therefore, the statement made by Tim Kaine on 7/14/2016 that ""Says Donald Trump is 'against minimum wage'"" is mostly true, but it would be more accurate to say that Trump has expressed skepticism about the minimum wage and has not taken a definitive stance for or against it.",D,economy,50000-100000

Tim Kaine's statement that ""The tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification.

During George Allen's term as governor from 1994 to 1998, the tax burden increased from 8.9% to 9.2%. However, it's important to note that this comparison only looks at state and local taxes and does not include federal taxes. Additionally, other factors such as economic conditions and population growth could have influenced tax burdens during these time periods. Therefore, while the statement is mostly true, it would be more accurate to say that Virginia families had a lower state and local tax burden under Kaine than under Allen, but the overall tax burden (including federal taxes) could have been higher or lower depending on various factors.",D,economy,50000-100000

The statement that ""Georgians spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back from the federal government"" is mostly true, but it requires some clarification.

However, this figure does not take into account the fact that some federal spending in Georgia benefits residents of other states as well.

Tom Graves, the source of the statement, is a Republican congressman representing Georgia's 14th district. He made the statement during a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives on March 7, 2014, while advocating for more control over federal spending and a reduction in regulations.

This statement can be fact checked by examining whether Tammy Baldwin indeed supports a tax increase that would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year, as claimed by Tommy Thompson.

To fact check this statement, we need to look for credible sources that provide information on Tammy Baldwin's stance on tax increases and their potential impact on middle-class families.

According to the nonpartisan fact-checking organization PolitiFact, there is evidence that Tammy Baldwin did support a tax increase that could affect middle-class families, but the $3,000 figure is an exaggeration. The tax increase in question is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.
